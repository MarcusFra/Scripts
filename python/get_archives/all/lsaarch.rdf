Maintainer-Email: cerbe@lumsa.it
Description: The Center for Relationship Banking and Economics (CERBE) was established in 2013 with the aim of developing avenues of research and training in order to better understand the importance of relational goods as a means to overcome a simple Laissex-faire approach. In particular, the Center conducts academic research, from both the empirical and theoretical points of view, on two main fields: Relationship Banking and Relationship Economics. 
These aims are pursued through many activities, including sponsored research, seminars, conferences carried out by a group of economists from the LUMSA University, in cooperation with researchers from other universities and institutions.
