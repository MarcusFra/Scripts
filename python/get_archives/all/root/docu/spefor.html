<h2>1: Introduction</h2>
<p>This document is available in PDF format for <a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/.papers/spefor.letter.pdf">US letter size
paper</a> and
for <a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/.papers/spefor.a4.pdf">A4 size
paper</a>.

<p>It gives details of how the ReDIF format is being encoded in a special
specification file. This file is normally called "redif.spec".  This
documentation explains how to make changes to a ReDIF specification. One can
make enhancements to an existing specification or design a new specification
from scratch.
<p>Before trying to understand the specification of ReDIF, one should
understand the ReDIF data format documentation well, because this
document is like a dark side of the moon for ReDIF:it is better look at
the bright side first.
<p>The ReDIF specification file contains a ReDIF
specification in a custom-built format called the "SPEcification FOrmat
for Redif", abbreviated spefor.  The spefor file is loaded each time any
data reading starts. It defines:
<dl> 
<p><li > template types and cluster types
<p><li > attributes (fields) names and other properties in each template
type or cluster type
<p><li > attribute data types: checking and preprocessing
<p></dl>
<p>Each cluster and template has a finite set of allowed attributes, some of
which may be required to appear in every template of the type.  An
attribute in a template or a cluster must have a defined (complete) name
and may have some additional properties set.  The additional properties of
an attribute are: type of value, the permission to omit and the prohibition
to repeat the attribute in a template.
<p><a name="l2"></a>
<h2>2: Syntax</h2>
<p><a name="l3"></a>
<h3>2.1: General aspects of the syntax</h3>
<p>The spefor syntax borrows some features of Perl code syntax.  Comment lines
start with the hash char <code>#</code> symbol. Repetitions of whitespace (i.e. blanks
and tabulation characters) are ignored.
<p>Spefor files make extensive use of blocks of text.
Blocks start with the open curly brace <code>{</code> character and 
end with the close curly brace <code>}</code> character.
Unlike in C or Perl, each block closes with a line consisting of a
single <code>}</code> character, not taking spaces and tab chars into account.
<p>This means that in the following example:<pre>
A { 
</pre>
<em>block's code here</em><pre>
}
 B {  
</pre>
<em>  other data or code</em><code> }
 </code>
<p>block <code>A</code> is correctly closed, but the block <code>B</code> is not. The
difference is a newline character before closing brace <code>}</code>.
This imposes a limitation on the contents of each block: you can
not put a line with single <code>}</code> inside a block. Be
careful with Perl code in blocks.
<p>The ReDIF specification is specified by a number of definitions.  In other
words, definitions are the main structural elements of the spefor file.
<p><a name="l4"></a>
<h3>2.2: Definition syntax</h3>
<p>A definition states what is being defined and how it will be named and then
gives the contents of the definition in a block. The most common syntax 
is 
<p><tt><i>def_type</tt></i>
<code> = </code><tt><i>name</tt></i>
 <tt><i> block </tt></i>
<code>'\n'</code>
<p><code>'\n'</code> designates a newline character here. 
In some cases, you will also see definitions of the syntax
<p><tt><i>def_type</tt></i>
<code> = </code><tt><i>name</tt></i>
 [<code>/ </code><tt><i>parameter</tt></i>
] <tt><i> block </tt></i>
<code>'\n'</code>
<p>The item in square brackets is optional here. 
<p>There are three types of definitions. Therefore <tt><i>def_type</tt></i>
 variable can take
only three values. These are <code>template</code>, <code>cluster</code> and <code>type</code>. These
values are case-insensitive.
<p><a name="l5"></a>
<h3>2.3: Template type definition</h3><a name="temptypedefines"></a>
<p>A template type definition lists attributes of a template and sets
their properties.  The <tt><i>name</tt></i>
 variable of the definition line gives
the template type name in full, like <code>ReDIF-Paper 1.0</code> for
example. All its attributes are listed inside the definition
<tt><i>block</tt></i>
.  Each attribute is listed on a separate line. Each
non-empty line defines one attribute of the template. Its syntax is
<p><tt><i>attribute_name</tt></i>
[<code>:</code>[<tt><i>type</tt></i>
][<code>:</code>[<tt><i>subtype</tt></i>
][<code>:</code>[<tt><i>required_flag</tt></i>
][<code>:</code>[<tt><i>non_repeatable_flag</tt></i>
]]]]]
<p>Whitespace characters are not allowed inside this string. They are allowed at
the beginning or end of the string.  The colon character is a delimiter here. 
The only part of the line which is required is the <tt><i>attribute_name</tt></i>
. <tt><i>type</tt></i>
<p>and <tt><i>subtype</tt></i>
 have several different uses for different cases, but in general
they specify content properties of the attribute. In most cases only <tt><i>type</tt></i>
<p>is given, the <tt><i>subtype</tt></i>
 parameter has less usage.
<p>The meaning of the <tt><i>required_flag</tt></i>
 is to answer the following
question: Is this attribute necessary to consider template or cluster
valid or it is optional?  The value <code>1</code> in the <tt><i>required_flag</tt></i>
<p>means that the attribute is required.
<p>The meaning of <tt><i>non_repeatable_flag</tt></i>
 is to answer the following
question: Can this attribute appear several times in one template or
cluster?  By default attributes can be repeated, but if you set
<tt><i>non_repeatable_flag</tt></i>
 to <code>1</code>, then the attribute will become
non-repeatable.
<p>A special format exists for key attributes of template and cluster
types. If in the <tt><i>required_flag</tt></i>
 field of the attribute definition there
is an asterisk '<tt><i>*</tt></i>
' (instead of <code>1</code> or anything else), then this attribute
will become the key attribute of the template or the cluster.
<p>In all other cases <tt><i>required_flag</tt></i>
 and <tt><i>non_repeatable_flag</tt></i>
 may
contain any digits, but normal value for it is 1 or nothing by
default.
<p>An example of a valid template type definition:
<p><pre>
template = ReDIF-Person 1.0 {
	Template-Type:::*
        Handle:::1:1
        Name-Full:::1:1
        Name-First
        Name-Last
        WorkPlace:cluster:Organization::
        Email
        Fax
        Postal
        Phone
        Homepage:URL
      # Homepage-Publications:URL
      # Classification-Jel
}
</pre>

This example defines the template type <code>ReDIF-Person 1.0</code>.  The attribute
<code>Template-type</code> is the key attribute of the template, the <code>Handle</code> and
<code>Name-Full</code> attributes are required and non-repeatable. The attribute
<code>Workplace</code> is of type <code>cluster</code> and subtype <code>Organization</code>. The
attribute <code>Homepage</code> is of type <code>URL</code>.  Lines with
<code>Homepage-Publications</code> and <code>Classification-Jel</code> attributes are
commented out. They are not included into the template type.
<p><a name="l6"></a>
<h3>2.4: Cluster type definition</h3>
<p>Clusters are groups of attributes.
They are defined outside the template types and may be 
used as a group in various templates
to build composite elements.  For example consider
the following cluster definition<pre>
cluster = address {
 Country:::*
 state:
 county
 zipcode
 city:::1:1
 street
}
</pre>

<p>Similarly to template type definitions,  a cluster type definition
contains a list of attribute names with their properties. This
particular example (above) defines a cluster type named <code>address</code>.
<p>Elements of a cluster type (attributes) can not be used directly in any
template.  To use a cluster in some template type, we need to introduce it
there through an ordinary
attribute.  The attributes of the cluster then can appear
in the data being prefixed by that attribute and a dash.
<p>For example, this means that if we introduce a cluster of type <code>address</code>
into some template through an attribute <code>Home</code> then following data lines
may be valid inside such templates:<pre>
Home-Country: U.S.A.
Home-State: CA
Home-City: Santa Barbara
</pre>

<p>More detailed explanation about how to introduce a cluster into a
template will be found in one of the following sections.
<p>Once defined a cluster type can be used in any template or even cluster type. 
The scope of the cluster type definition's is global and clusters can be 
nested.
<p><a name="l7"></a>
<h2>3: Attribute types</h2>
<p>When we list attributes in a template or a cluster type definition 
we can specify each attribute as having a certain <tt><i>type</tt></i>
. 
There is one special type of attributes which will be described right in
the next section. It is the type <code>cluster</code>.
<p><a name="l8"></a>
<h3>3.1: Attribute type <code>cluster</code></h3>
<p>If the <tt><i>type</tt></i>
 property of an attribute line takes value  <code>cluster</code>,
then the <tt><i>subtype</tt></i>
 shall point to a specific cluster type.  For example if we
have defined cluster type <code>course</code>, then in a template type definition
for a teacher we can put following attribute
line:<pre>
teaching:cluster:course
</pre>

<p>In this case the attribute <code>teaching</code> in the template type will
represent a cluster of type <code>course</code>. Attributes of this cluster
type may appear in any template of this type, being prefixed by
<code>teaching-</code>.  For example, look at a template
<p><pre>
Template-Type: ReDIF-Teacher 1.0
Name: Thomas Krichel
Teaching-Course-Name: Dynamic Macroeconomics
Teaching-Course-Class-Size: 25  
Teaching-Course-Name: Open Economy Macroeconomics
Teaching-Course-Class-Size: 20
Handle: RePEc:per:teachr:T_Krichel
</pre>

<p>Such a template is possible if the cluster type <code>course</code>
has been defined as<pre>
cluster = course {
   course-name:::*
   course-class-size
}
</pre>

<p>Exactly the same mechanism can be used to include clusters into other
clusters, i.e. clusters can be nested. 
<p><a name="l9"></a>
<h2>4: User-defined value data types</h2><a name="sec:userdefinedvaluetypes"></a>
<p>All we dealt with up to this moment are the ReDIF template structures.
Having defined a template structure is important for parsing and validating
data, but sometimes more deep checking of data is desired.  And this is
what this section is about.
<p>We have shown how an attribute specified in a template type or a
cluster type definition can bring a cluster into a corresponding
structure.  We use a special value of <code>cluster</code> of the <code>type</code>
property of an attribute for that.
<p>In other cases, the type of an attribute is used to specify the
attribute's value data type.  These types are types of value that this
attribute may take.  In most cases this property is empty
which means that no certain data type has been assigned, and any value
is possible.
<p>For example, we can define a data type <code>date</code> for our date-related
attributes and then declare those attributes as having value type <code>date</code>.
This will impose some checking and processing rules of the <code>date</code> data
type on all appearances of the attributes or, to be more correct, on the
values of the attributes.  To set those checking and processing rules we
use the Perl programming language. We will be more elaborate on that
subject in the following sections.
<p><a name="l10"></a>
<h3>4.1: Defining data value types</h3>
<p>Value types define rules by which the attribute values will be
processed when a ReDIF data file is being read or checked.  Attributes
may be associated with a value data type through a cluster or template type
definition, as it has been shown in the previous sections.
<p>The value data type definition syntax is
<p><code>type =</code> <tt><i>type_name</tt></i>
 [<code>/</code> <tt><i>type_aspect</tt></i>
] <tt><i>block</tt></i>
 <code>'\n'</code>
<p>The <tt><i>type_aspect</tt></i>
 specifies how to interpret the definition's content
block.  This parameter may take three different values
<p><dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>check-regex</strong><dd>  a regular expression for checking value;
  this is the default.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>check-eval</strong><dd>   a piece of Perl code for checking value
<p><p></p><dt><strong>preproc-eval</strong><dd> a piece of Perl code for preprocessing value 
<p></dl>
<p><a name="l11"></a>
<h3>4.2: Type aspects: check-regex</h3>
<p>For example, let us look at a following definition:<pre>

type = handle / check-regex {
     ^RePEc\:[a-zA-Z]{3}(\:[a-zA-Z0-9]{6}(\:[^\s\n]+)?)?$
}
</pre>

<p>It defines a <code>check-regex</code> aspect of data type <code>handle</code>.  As a result,
all values of <code>handle</code> type attributes will be checked to match the
Perl regular expression in the braces above.
<p>Thus the <code>check-regex</code> aspect allows to set the syntax of attribute values in
the form of a Perl regular expression. Values that don't match the Perl regular
expression would be rejected and the corresponding template will be invalid.
<p><a name="l12"></a>
<h3>4.3: Type aspects: check-eval</h3>
<p>The <code>check-eval</code> aspect allows to set checking routine code for
values of the data type in Perl language. The code is evaluated at
run-time. Depending on the return value (or last expression, evaluated
in the block), the attribute is accepted or rejected.
<p>In the code one has access to the value which we need to be check by a
scalar variable <tt><i>$value</tt></i>
. Let's look at an example
<pre>
type = pubstat / check-eval  {
   if (   $value !~ /^Forthcoming/i or 
          $value !~ /^Published/i ) {
            return 0;
   } else { return 1; }
}
</pre>

This type is for the Publication-Status attribute, whose value must start with
one of <code>Forthcoming</code> and <code>Published</code> case-insensitive.
<p>Here again let us remind that one cannot use single closing brace
<code>}</code> on a line inside a block. So if we write the same piece in a
different way<pre>
type = pubstat / check-eval     {
   if (   $value  !~ /^Forthcoming/i 
       or $value !~ /^Published/i ) {
             return 0;
   } else {
             return 1;
   }
}
</pre>

this will cause an error at spefor file (redif.spec) reading.
<p>There is another one interesting feature in <tt><i>check-eval</tt></i>
 aspect of
types.  An author or maintainer of data often wants to know why this
or that template is rejected.  The <em>rech</em> data checking script for this
purpose uses so-called messages.  
<p>A message has a text (content) and a status. A status is one of several levels:
from a debugging note (lowest) to a fatal error message (highest). But
the two most often used levels are: a warning and an error.  For further
technical details please consult <em>rech</em>, <em>rr.pm</em> and <em>messages.pm</em> Perl
files.
<p>If during reading a template somewhere appears a message with status
of error or higher, then the template will be rejected.  Depending on
the invocation of <em>rech</em>, the message content may be printed to the
standard output.
<p>Should a type checking aspect <em>check-regex</em> or <em>check-eval</em>
executed for a particular value
produce a negative result, the parsing software will generate a
message of a general form, stating that <code>value XXX of type
YYY is invalid</code> or alike.
<p>If one wants to make for clever and friendly checking for your data, he
may want to change this kind of message to a different one, showing
exactly what is the problem of the data.  To make this in
<em>check-eval</em> aspect definition you may yourself initiate a message.
To initiate a message you simply call a function <em>msg</em>.  But to
exclude error duplication, if you initiate an error message in a
<em>check-eval</em> block, be sure to return a positive value at the end.
<p>The <em>msg</em> subroutine accepts the message text as the first
parameter, and a number - the status level as the second parameter.
<p>The status level of 2 corresponds to a warning, 3 - to an error. 
<p>For example, the code in the following type definition may generate an
error message when the corresponding value is incorrect.
<p><pre>
 type = integer / check-eval {

     if ($value =~ /^\d+$/) {
	msg "($file, $line): Value &lt;$value&gt; is not an integer", 3;
	return 1;    # as if it was OK
     ;}
}
</pre>

Thus function <em>msg</em> sends a message.  The <em>$file</em> and <em>$line</em> 
variables will be equal to the data filename and the line number
position in the file.
<p>Apart from figuring out and reporting errors, you can also give user a
warning about data.  Let's look into another example
<p><pre>
type = URL / check-eval {
   if (     $value =~ /^(ftp|http):\/\//i 
        and $value !~ /^(ftp|http):\/\// ) {
          msg "($file, $line): URL capitalization is bad &lt;$value&gt;", 2;
          $value =~ s/^Ftp/ftp/i;
          $value =~ s/^Http/http/i;
   ;}

   $value =~ /^(URL:)?
      (ftp|http|gopher)\:
      \/\/[a-zA-Z0-9\_\.\-]+
      (\:[0-9]+)?
      (\/?|[\~\&amp;\%\^\@\!\'\"\`\(\)\|\#\:\;\/A-Za-z\-\_0-9\?\=\*\\\+\,\.]+)$/x;
}
</pre>

<p>In the first part of this <em>check-eval</em> we check the capitalization of
the starting part of a URL (protocol, like http or ftp). 
The line
<p><pre>
msg "($file, $line): URL capitalization is bad \"$value\"", 2;
</pre>

<p>creates a message with status 2 (Warning).  The template will not be
ignored.  Then we correct the capitalization of the value and go
further.  In the finishing part of the block we check the value to
match a big regular expression (Perl5 extended syntax - note "/x" in
the end).  The logical value calculated in the result of this matching
operator will trigger an error if the value does not match.
<p><a name="l13"></a>
<h3>4.4: Type aspects: preproc</h3>
<p>Another useful function that a ReDIF parsing software (which is behind
<em>rech</em>, <em>rere</em> or <em>rr.pm</em>) may perform is in to convert attribute values
from the form in which the author has written it to some other
(possibly, standardized) form.  
<p>Historically within the RePEc project, a need for this feature arose
with the use of the subject classification codes defined by the
Journal of Economic Literature, the JEL codes.  For example, we could
do (and actually did) so, that a sample value of JEL classification 
attribute <code>a21; b3, X3</code>
would be automagically converted to <code>A21 B3</code> at the data reading
stage, `on the fly'.  This conversion includes: change to the uppercase
letters, separation by single space characters, and ignoring
(filtering out) the invalid code <code>X3</code>. 
<p>It is implemented using a <code>preproc</code> value data type aspect.  It
works very much like <code>check-eval</code>.  The <code>preproc</code> type block is
<code>eval</code>-uated in Perl while reading data, but the resulting
(returned) value does not matter.
<p>Consider another following example:
<p><pre>
type = date / preproc { 
   return if $value eq ''; 
  if ($value !~ /-/ ) {
      $value =~ s/^(\d{4})(\d{2})$/$1-$2/; 
      $value =~ s/^(\d{4})(\d{2})(\d{2})/$1-$2-$3/; } 
  if ($value !~ /^\d{4}(-\d\d){0,2}$/ ) {
      if ($rr::Options{'MessageOut'})  { 
          include_attrline( ); 
          msg "($file, $line): A bad date value format: \"$value\"", 2; 
      } else { $value = '' ; } 
      return 1; 
  ;} 
}
</pre>
 
<p>This example is for attributes of the <em>date</em> type.  Dates are
converted to a standard form or cleared to <code>''</code>, if original value is
of incorrect format.  But if this code is executed in the data checking
mode (for example, in <em>rech</em> script) which is checked by
<code>$rr::Options{'MessageOut'}</code> then a warning message is generated.
Also note a function call before creating a message:
<p><code>include_attrline( );</code>
<p>This is necessary for correct rech output if you generate messages in
<code>preproc</code>.
<p><a name="l14"></a>
<h2>5: Checking sequence</h2>
<p>Just to clear some possible questions, here we have a brief introduction
about how the ReDIF data is being parsed and how the spefor file is being used.
<p>When a ReDIF parsing engine behind <em>rr.pm</em>, <em>rere</em> and <em>rech</em> reads
an attribute, it checks some control values i.e. it asks several questions
about an attribute.  If any of a question leads to a negative result,
an error is being created.  And such an error causes the whole template to
be treated as invalid.  The template is ignored and the processing program
(the parser's client) cannot see it.
<p>The first thing checked about attribute is whether the attribute is
correctly placed. Is it allowed for the current template and/or
cluster type(s)?  If the attribute is repeated, is it allowed to be
repeated here?
<p>If the attribute fits well into the template structure (does not
violate the template type), the parser then checks the value of the
attribute.
<p>The engine then checks what type of attribute it is (as it is defined
in the template or cluster type).  If its type is <code>cluster</code>, then
the engine <em>opens</em> a new cluster.  If it is of some data type, that
type's <code>preproc</code> aspect is checked and executed (<code>eval</code>-uated), if
it has been defined in spefor.  Then <code>check-regex</code> is matched if
defined.  Next step is <code>check-eval</code> <code>eval</code>-uation, you guessed,
if defined.
<p>If at the <code>check-regex</code> or the <code>check-eval</code> stage a negative result has
been received, then the engine generates an error and stops further
processing of the template. Actually the same happens if an error appears
in the <code>pre-proc</code> aspect.
<p>When a new <code>Template-type</code> attribute is encountered or an end of file is
reached, the template is checked to contain all <em>required</em> attributes of
the template type.  Processing the template goes on successfully only if
this check returns positive result.  After that the template is considered
to be complete and valid.
