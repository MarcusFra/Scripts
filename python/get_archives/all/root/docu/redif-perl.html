<h1>Reading ReDIF files: the <em>ReDIF-Perl</em> package</h1>
<h2><h3>Ivan Kurmanov with Thomas Krichel</h3></h2>
<h2><h4>July 2000</h4></h2>


<p><a name="l1"></a>
<h2>1: Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes <em>ReDIF-perl</em>, a set of Perl modules to read
<a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/redif_1.html">ReDIF</a>) data.
It is is available in PDF
format for <a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/.papers/redif-perl.letter.pdf">US letter size
paper</a>
and for <a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/.papers/redif-perl.a4.pdf">A4 size
paper</a>
.
<p>The main component of <em>ReDIF-perl</em> is <em>rr.pm</em> is a Perl module to read
<a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/docu/redif_1.html">ReDIF</a> data.  It reads
ReDIF data, validates the structure of the contents against a ReDIF
specification contained in a separate specification file, and puts the
valid templates into a hash structure where they can be easily accessed for
further processing.
<p><a name="l2"></a>
<h2>2: Installing ReDIF-perl</h2>
<p><a name="l3"></a>
<h3>2.1: Downloading the package</h3>
<p><em>ReDIF-perl</em> is available at
<a href="ftp://openlib.org/acmes/root/soft/ReDIF-perl/">ftp://openlib.org/acmes/root/soft/ReDIF-perl/</a>. Unpack the software, then
read the file <code>README</code> for the latest changes that may not be documented
in this page yet.
<p>The package contains
<dl>
   <li > the <em>rr.pm</em> perl module as an application interface to the ReDIF 
     parser
   <li > the <em>ReDIF::init.pm</em> perl module as a shared tool 
     for ReDIF developers
   <li > <code>rech</code>, the  ReDIF checking script 
   <li > <code>rere</code>, the  ReDIF reading (filtering) script 
   <li > <code>Makefile.PL</code>, the installation tool (makefile generator)
   <li > <code>Configure</code>, the configuration utility 
   <li > related documentation about <em>rr.pm</em>, <code>rech</code> and <code>redif.spec</code>  
</dl>
<p><a name="l4"></a>
<h3>2.2: Choosing a ReDIF home</h3>
<p>If you have a normal directory structure as set out by the Guildford
protocol, then should set the ReDIF home to be your archive directory. If
you do not have such a directory structure, proceed as follows.
<p>Choose and create a directory that will be the ReDIF home and copy the
<code>spec/</code>, <code>etc/</code> and <code>doc/</code> directories of the package.  If you didn't
install the package with "make install" command into a generally accessibly
Perl library tree, then you also need to copy the lib/ dir and rech and
rere scripts. Create a <code>data/</code> directory as a subdirectory of the ReDIF
home and store your ReDIF data files in it. This method is known as a
"stand-alone" installation of ReDIF-perl.  Don't forget to look at the
REDIFHOME/etc/rech.conf.eg file.
<p>Generally, you will want to use this package if you have or are going to
have your own archive that contains ReDIF metadata as suggested by the
Guildford protocol.  Alternatively, you may find it useful if you produce
or process, or otherwise work with the ReDIF data or if you developing some
software that uses ReDIF data.
<p>Note that the package also contains a ReDIF specification file in the
<code>spec/</code> directory. However, please check with the community that uses
ReDIF if that specification is current.  You will find in the <code>doc/</code>
directory of the package.  In the <code>etc/</code> you will find default
configuration file for rech.  The Perl modules themselves live in the
<code>lib/</code> directory.
<p><a name="l5"></a>
<h3>2.3: Installing the package files</h3>
<p>To install this package onto your machine use the following standard
commands (I assume you have already unpacked the package onto your
harddisk):<pre>
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
</pre>

<p>The <code>perl Makefile.PL</code> command will also execute the Configure utility
which will help you to set the only one, but valuable parameter: your ReDIF
home directory.  The is your archive's directory if you have one. It may be
any other directory, where you will create a so-called stand-alone ReDIF
home (see next section).  Configure will ask you about the directory name
and will suggest to you to create one if it does not already exist. However
it will not create more than one level of new directories.
<p>The last step, <code>make install</code> installs <em>rr.pm</em> and other related
libraries into a directory where perl will find them.  For this step you
will most likely wish to use superuser rights, if you have them.  If you
need to make a private installation of ReDIF-Perl use the
<code>PREFIX=</code><em>DIR</em> option of <code>perl Makefile.PL</code> command or execute
<em>Makefile.PL</em> with your private copy of perl.  After this procedure the
<em>rech</em> and <em>rere</em> scripts shall be installed to a directory which is
already included into your <code>$PATH</code> (e.g. <code>/usr/bin</code>). They can then be
executed by from everywhere on your system.
<p>You do not need to determine the ReDIF home directory at the installation
stage.  In that case you use the environment variable, REDIFDIR or you run
the software from that directory, or you give a command-line parameter
<code>--rdir</code> (or <code>--redif.dir</code>).  The choice is yours.
<p><a name="l6"></a>
<h2>3: The functions provided by <em>rr.pm</em></h2>
<p>To call a function from <em>rr.pm</em>, you need to make Perl find it by a
<code>use</code> or <code>require</code> Perl statement.
<p><code>use rr</code>
<p>The <em>rr.pm</em> module provides a ReDIF reading interface through the
functions <code>&amp;rr::OpenRDF</code>, <code>&amp;rr::OpenDir</code>, <code>&amp;rr::OpenDirTree</code> and
<code>&amp;rr:NextTemplate</code>.  The first three of these are for opening the data
source of different types. They initiate a data stream through reading.
The <code>&amp;rr::NextTemplate</code> function iterates through the stream of data,
opened by an <code>&amp;rr::Open...</code> function, allowing you to access the actual
data, template by template.
<p><a name="l7"></a>
<h3>3.1: <code>&amp;rr::OpenRDF</code></h3>
<p>Use: <br>
<code>&amp;rr::OpenRDF </code><tt><i>filename</tt></i><br>
<code>&amp;rr::OpenRDF </code><tt><i>filename</tt></i>[<code>, </code><tt><i>filepos</tt></i>]<br>)
<code>&amp;rr::OpenRDF </code><tt><i>filename</tt></i>[<code>, </code><tt><i>filepos</tt></i><code>, </code>][<tt><i>showfilename</tt></i>]<br>
<p>This is the basic function, which initiates reading of a ReDIF file
<tt><i>filename</tt></i>.  It returns 1 if successful, 0 if not.
<p>The optional <tt><i>filepos</tt></i> parameter (integer number) shall be used to read
the file from a specific position within the file.  This may be useful if
you need to get a specific template and as quickly as possible.  By default
the file is being read from the beginning, of course.
<p>The optional <tt><i>showfilename</tt></i> shows how the file should be referred to,
i.e. the logical file name. This will be the name in the
<code>$::HashT{'FILENAME'}</code>.  Imagine that you read a file called
<code>/home/tim/RePEc/bob/bobseri.rdf</code>.  You may want it to be referred to
as just <code>bob/bobseri.rdf</code>, because <code>/home/tim/RePEc/</code> is not
important and will be the same for all ReDIF files being read. In that
case, use
<p><code>&amp;rr::tt(rr::OpenRDF)( '/home/tim/RePEc/bob/bobseri.rdf', 0, 'bob/bobseri.rdf');</code>
<p>This feature may appear superfluous, but is quite useful in a range of
applications.  By default, the logical name is the same as physical
<tt><i>filename</tt></i>.
<p><a name="l8"></a>
<h3>3.2: <code>&amp;rr::OpenDir</code></h3>
<p>Use:<br>
<code>&amp;rr::OpenDir</code> <tt><i>directory</tt></i><br>
<code>&amp;rr::OpenDir</code> <tt><i>directory</tt></i>[<code>, </code><tt><i>showprefixlength</tt></i>]<br>)
<code>&amp;rr::OpenDir</code> <tt><i>directory</tt></i>[<code>, </code><tt><i>showprefixlength</tt></i>][<code>, </code><tt><i>filtersub</tt></i>]<br>
<p>Whereas <code>&amp;rr::OpenRDF</code> function starts one-file data stream, this function
opens a whole directory of ReDIF files for consequent reading template by
template.  Thus it is a higher level function. The exact filename the
template has been read from is stored in the <code>$::HashT{'FILENAME'}</code>
variable at each specific template.  Following the conventions of the
Guildford protocol, only files with the extension <code>.rdf</code> (case
insensitive) are taken.  The function returns the number of ReDIF files
found if successful, 0 if not.  You give the pathname of the directory to
be read in <tt><i>directory</tt></i>.
<p>The optional <tt><i>showprefixlength</tt></i> parameter is for the same reasons as
<tt><i>showfilename</tt></i> parameter at <code>rr::OpenRDF</code>. But this value just sets how
many of the starting characters of the <tt><i>directory</tt></i> to strip as
meaningless to get a nice logical name.  So if you, say, read the directory
<code>/home/bob/RePEc/bob/dylan0</code>, and you want logical names of the files to
be <code>bob/dylan0/...</code> then give length of <code>/home/bob/RePEc/</code> as a
<tt><i>showprefixlength</tt></i>, e.g. 
<pre>
rr::tt(rr::OpenDir)('/home/tim/RePEc/bob/dylan0',length('/home/tim/RePEc/'));
</pre>

By default, the logical name is the same as the physical full filename.
<p>If the optional <tt><i>filtersub</tt></i> parameter is specified, it applies a
user-defined filter function to choose templates that satisfy a
user-defined set of criteria. This feature is described Section
<a href="redif-perl.html#sec:filter">5</a>.
<p><a name="l9"></a>
<h3>3.3: <code>&amp;rr::OpenDirTree</code></h3>
<p>Use:<br>
<code>&amp;rr::OpenDirTree </code><tt><i>directory</tt></i><br>
<code>&amp;rr::OpenDirTree </code><tt><i>directory</tt></i><code>, </code>[<tt><i>showprefixlength</tt></i>]<br>)
<code>&amp;rr::OpenDirTree </code><tt><i>directory</tt></i><code>, </code>[<tt><i>showprefixlength</tt></i>]<code>, </code>[<tt><i>filtersub</tt></i>]<br>
<p>This function is very much like the previous one, but it does a
sub-directory tree search for all ReDIF files. And similarly it returns
number of ReDIF files found if successful, 0 if not.  The <tt><i>showprefix</tt></i>
and <tt><i>filtersub</tt></i> parameters have the same meaning as for the
<code>rr::OpenDir</code> function.
<p><a name="l10"></a>
<h3>3.4: <code>&amp;rr::NextTemplate</code></h3>
<p>This function iterates the current data stream (previously opened) to the
next template. It returns 1 if successful, 0 if not. In case of a one-file
stream <code>&amp;rr::OpenRDF</code>, if 0 is returned from the <code>&amp;rr::NextTemplate</code> it
means that you have reached the end of the file.  In case of multi-file
streams <code>&amp;rr::OpenDir</code> and <code>&amp;rr::OpenDirTree</code> it means that you have
reached the last correct template of the last ReDIF file that was found.
<p><a name="l11"></a>
<h2>4: How to access the data</h2>
<p>There are two ways of accessing the data in your scripts.  You may choose
to use one of them or both (or none) by setting appropriate options in the
hash <code>%rr::Options</code>. The selected modes will influence the way reading
goes internally and each way of accessing the data takes some run-time
resources to prepare.
<p>The two major forms of the data presentation are
<dl> 
<li >full-text in one multi-line string variable. This is the
output of the <code>rere</code> script.
<li >structured (to reflect template logic) hash variable 
</dl> 
Both forms allow processing of one template by at a time only.
We discuss the structured hash form first.
<p><a name="l12"></a>
<h3>4.1: The structure of <code>%::HashT</code></h3>
<p>When the structured presentation is enabled, then after a successful
<code>rr::NextTemplate</code> function, a variable <code>%::HashT</code> will be filled up
with a ReDIF template data according to the following rules.
<p><a name="l13"></a>
<strong>4.1.1: Rule (a): non-cluster attributes</strong><p>
<p>Simple (non-cluster) attributes of the read template become keys of the
<code>%::HashT</code> and these keys have the values associated with them. The names
of keys are converted to lowercase.  For example, <em>Handle</em> is a simple,
non-cluster attribute. After reading a template, <code>$::HashT{'handle'}</code>
(mind lower case!)  will give you the value of the handle.  For other
simple attributes like "Title", "Abstract", "Creation-Date" (for
Paper or Article templates), "Name" (Archive, Series), "Template-Type"
and many others, it is exactly the same. Example: 
<p><pre>
print "Paper: $::HashT{'title'} ($::HashT{'handle'})\n";
</pre>

<p>If <code>$T</code> is a reference to the hash, then you may use it to access the data
from <code>%::HashT</code> by writing a bit less code. For example, in the following
piece of code you can observe example of using a reference to <code>%::HashT</code>
instead of using <code>%::HashT</code> itself. After reading a template the script
processes it depending on its type:
<p><pre>
 # Assigning to the $T variable a value of the reference to %::HashT
  $T = \%::HashT;
  #
  # some rr::Open... function call is supposed here
  #
  return if !&amp;rr::NextTemplate;  # loading a new template
  #
  # checking the template type:
  #
  if ($T-&gt;{'template-type'} eq 'redif-paper 1.0') {
      
      print "Keywords: $T-&gt;{'keywords'}\n";
  } elsif ($T-&gt;{'template-type'} eq 'redif-archive 1.0') {
      
      print "Archive description: $T-&gt;{'description'}\n";
  }
</pre>

<p><a name="l14"></a>
<strong>4.1.2: Rule (b): clusters</strong><p>
<p>Clusters of templates are repeatable. They may be repeated several times in
one template and the same attributes in different repeated clusters should
not be mixed up, as they are supposed to only have sense within a
cluster. Each cluster of a template read by <em>rr.pm</em> will be represented
as an array element. For example, a document's author names are set
referred to by "Author-Name" attribute and more generally described by
"Author-(*PERSON)" cluster. In the hash <code>%::HashT</code> they will be
represented as elements of the <code>@$::HashT{'author'}</code> array.
<p>This means that the "author" key of <code>%::HashT</code> will point to (reference to)
an array, which has as many entries as there are authors.  Each value will
point to an independent hash, containing the author's "(*PERSON)" cluster
data.
<p>For example,<pre>
  # assume a paper template has been successfully loaded
  print "The paper has " , $#$::HashT{'author'}+1, " author(s):\n";
  #
  # now iterate through each author
  foreach $au ( @$::HashT{'author'} ) {
        # now $au contains a reference to an author's data
        print "The author is $au -&gt; {'name'}\n" ; 
  }
</pre>

or<pre>
  # initializations
  $T = \%::HashT;
  $authors = $T-&gt;{'author'};
  #
  # an effort to be correct in English: checking the number of authors
  #
  if ($#$authors &gt; 0) { $suffix = 's'; }
  else { $suffix = ''; }
  #
  print "Author$suffix:\n";

</pre>

<p><a name="l15"></a>
<strong>4.1.3: Rule (c): attributes in clusters</strong><p>
<p>Each cluster data will in turn be coded as a hash with cluster attributes as
keys, similar to the rule (a). Clusters attributes will have the cluster prefix
(e.g. <code>author-</code>) stripped off. For instance,
<code>$::HashT{'author'}-&gt;[0]-&gt;{'name'}</code> will give you the first
author's name, i.e. the value contained in the "Author-Name" tag). Note that
the <code>-&gt;</code> are here optional.  If there are more than just one author, then
<code>$::HashT{'author'}[1]{'postal'}</code> will give second author's address,
i.e. the "author-postal" attribute in the second author cluster.  This rule
is valid for all clusters at all levels. If we have one cluster nested within
another (like "workplace-(*ORGANIZATION)" cluster in a "(*PERSON)"
 cluster), then
the latter cluster's hash will give us access to the second-level cluster
hash. A long expression like
<code>$::HashT{'editor'}[1]{'workplace'}[0]{'postal'}</code> would 
specify the postal address of the first workplace of the second editor of a
series.
<p><a name="l16"></a>
<strong>4.1.4: Other hash <code>%::HashT</code> elements</strong><p>
<p>The hash will also contain some additional information that is local to
your site.  Uppercase letters are used for this purpose. At the moment the
following information will be provided:
<p><code>%::HashT{'FILENAME'}</code> is the name of a file where the
template has been read from
<p><code>%::HashT{'STARTFPOS'}</code> is an integer number, signifying starting
position of a template in the file
<p><code>$::HashT{'BUFFER'}</code> will be assigned a value if only the <code>Buffer</code>
option is turned on. It will contain a multi-line string with the full-text
of the preprocessed ReDIF template. This is actually the way how the second
form of the data can be accessed.
<p>At the sub-hash (clusters) level there is one more technical uppercase
variable: <code>PREFIX</code>, e.g. <code>$T-&gt;{'file'}[0]{'PREFIX'}</code> or
<code>$T-&gt;{'author'}[0]{'PREFIX'}</code>.  This key stores the cluster
attributes' prefix: <code>'file-'</code> and <code>'author-'</code> respectively for the
examples.  The prefix and cluster's hash keys may be used to get the
original attributes of the template by uniting them in one string.
<p>Other uppercase keys of <code>%::HashT</code> may be used for internal or other
reasons in the future as software development goes on. User scripts
can use the keys of <code>%::HashT</code> as listed above, but should ignore
any other of them.
<p><a name="l17"></a>
<h3>4.2: Buffer output</h3>
<p>With this method you get the whole template in one string variable. Each
line contains one attribute, each attribute is separated from each value by
a ': ' combination, each line is separated from each other by a newline
character. Extra whitespace, tabulation or new-line characters are
removed. All multi-line values are converted to single-line. All
attribute:value pairs come checked and pre-processed.
<p>By default this data supply method is disabled. To enable this method you
need to turn on the <em>'Buffer'</em> option of the <code>%rr::Options</code> (before
opening a file), for example
<pre>
  $rr::Options {'Buffer'} = 1;
  &amp;rr::OpenRDF ( $file ) || die;
</pre>

You can switch this option between reading different files if you
need, but I can't guarantee you positive results if you switch it
while reading one file.
<p>After a successful <code>&amp;rr::NextTemplate</code>, you get a template in a string
as described above in a <code>$::HashT{'BUFFER'}</code>.
<p>For example<pre>
print "\$::HashT\{'BUFFER'} = '$::HashT{'BUFFER'}' ;\n"; 
</pre>

<p>will produce the following output (for instance)
<pre>
$::HashT{'BUFFER'} = 'template-type: ReDIF-Series 1.0

<h3>4.3: <em>rr.pm</em> Options</h3>
<p>The  user of <em>rr.pm</em> module can influence some aspects of the way it
works. We have already mentioned several of the options. Here comes
a full description.
<p>Option: <code>'HashT'</code><br>
Default: enabled (1)<br>
Meaning: This options sets whether to build the <code>%::HashT</code> variable from
the template attributes and values. If this is enabled, the full
template data: attribute:value pairs will be put into the <code>%::HashT</code>. If
disabled, only the <code>FILENAME</code>, <code>STARTFPOS</code> and <code>BUFFER</code> keys will have a
value in <code>%::HashT</code>.
<p>option: <code>'Buffer'</code><br>
Default: disabled (0)<br>
Meaning: This option sets whether you want to get a full-text of a template
in <code>%::HashT{'BUFFER'}</code>. By default, it is disabled.
<p>You may enable both of this options, but we recommend you to choose
only what is necessary, to avoid performance losses.
<p>Option: <code>'BufferEmpty'</code><br>
Default: disabled (0)<br>
Meaning: If 'Buffer' is enabled this option sets how to treat empty
attributes (with null value). If enabled, empty-value attributes will be
included into the <code>%::HashT{'BUFFER'}</code> and as a <code>%::HashT{...}</code>  lower
case attribute, otherwise it would be ignored as meaningless.
<p>Option: <code>'ReadX-Attr'</code><br>
Default: disabled (0)<br>
Meaning: This option determines whether to process and show to the
so-called X-attributes. X-attributes are the attributes that start with the
'X-' sequence.  If disabled, X-attributes will be ignored. If enabled they
will be included into <code>%::HashT{'BUFFER'}</code> and as a <code>%::HashT{...}</code>
lower case attribute.
<p>Other options exist that are used with scripts <em>rech</em> and <em>rere</em> scripts.
They should not be interesting to the <em>rr.pm</em> users.
<p><a name="l19"></a>
<h2>5: Search filters</h2><a name="sec:filter"></a>
<p>When you use the <code>rr::OpenDir</code> and <code>rr::OpenDirTree</code> 
functions for accessing a bunch of
ReDIF files, you may set a filter for the templates. Such a filter may
guarantee that while going through an opened data stream with
<code>rr::NextTemplate</code>, you will only get the templates which meet a certain
criteria. For example, you may want to choose templates by type: archive,
series, paper, article, software and so on.
<p>To execute such a search with filter, you can prepare a function, that
checks the criteria you need and returns the result. If the template is
fine, it returns true (e.g. 1), if not it return zero or the undefined
value.
<p>When you call the <code>rr::NextTemplate</code> subroutine, it will find a next piece of
data for you and then run the filter you have set. If the filter returns
true, then <code>rr::NextTemplate</code> will allow your programme to process it. If
filter returns a false value, <code>rr::NextTemplate</code> will look for a next one
template to offer. Clearly, setting the filter may cause the module to read
many templates in vain, thus wasting precious run-time resources. But some
people may find it efficient from programming efficiency point of view:
convenient, easy, etc.
<p>Here is a small example of using the filter. It should make things clearer.
<pre>
 # $RepecRemo = mirrored RePEc archives data directory
 #
 # this is a filter function that checks a criteria
 sub articlefilter {
     return 1 if $T-&gt;{'template-type'} eq 'redif-article 1.0';
     return 0;
 }
 sub checkOpenDirTree {
     my $f, $c, $l = length ("$RepecRemo") + 1;
     $T = \%::HashT;

     # executing a search with a filter here:
     $f = &amp;rr::OpenDirTree ( "$RepecRemo/cre/", $l, \&amp;articlefilter )  ;

     print "\nOpenDirTree $RepecRemo/cre/ : found ", $f ,
          " .RDF file entries\n" ;

     # processing ... (only article templates will get here)
     while ($c = &amp;rr::NextTemplate ) {
        print $T-&gt;{'FILENAME'} , ' : ' , $T-&gt;{'handle'}, "\n";
        $count ++;
     }
 }

</pre>

<p>This <code>checkOpenDirtree</code> subroutine will seek for ReDIF files in the
<em>cre</em> archive directory and in its subdirectories and will report
filenames and handles of each "article" template found.
<p><a name="l20"></a>
<h2>6: The <em>ReDIF::init.pm</em> module</h2>
<p>If you are writing an application that just needs to work in ReDIF
environment and wants to get the same installation and configuration info
as included software does, you may use perl module <em>ReDIF::init.pm</em>.
Function <code>initialize()</code> from that package will look for a configuration
information saved in a Perl-reachable module, will analyze @ARGV array
(command-line arguments), environment variables and the current working
directory, if necessary. It can help your program to identify: the ReDIF
home directory, it's type (Guildford protocol complient or stand-alone),
will find the configuration file for your program in the apropriate
directory (if it needs one).
<p>It will report the main configuration values worked out to the user (unless
you make it silent, which is easy) and will save them for you in the
<code>%ReDIF::CONFIG</code> hash variable. It will not import any symbols to your
package's namespace (unless you ask it to).
<p>For a detailed discussion of this module please see it's manpage
(<code>man ReDIF::init</code>) or pod data in <code>lib/ReDIF/init.pm</code>.
