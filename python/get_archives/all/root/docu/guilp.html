<h2>1: Introduction</h2>
<p>This document is the Guildford protocol. It is named after the town
where it has been written. The protocol provides a set of rules for
the publication and exchange of documents on the internet. It could be
implemented in any group that wishes to distribute documents on the
internet.
<p>The idea behind the protocol goes back to a statement by 
William L. Goffe. On 15 July 1995, he wrote on the (now defunct)
NetEc-admin list:
<p><blockquote>
  What I would suggest is this: a distributed system with any number of
  sites, each mirroring each other. It would have extensive
  bibliographic functions (cross-referencing, etc.), and my favorite,
  digital timestamps for when the papers were put up. For archives
  outside it, papers could be listed, but no cross-referencing. But,
  such archives could "join" the system (say it was written in perl so
  could run on NT as well as Unix). Then you'd have the best of both
  worlds: distributed, anybody could join, extensive cross-referencing,
  the whole works. Such a system could easily grow with the
  profession's use of the net. Such a system would GREATLY benefit the 
  profession.
</blockquote>
<p>The way to achieve this "global and local" archive is through a
comprehensive distribution process that is based on a set of archives. 
An archive is a machine that makes data available. It is a place where
original data enters the system. The data are then distributed to any
number of sites. A site is a collection of archives on the same
computer system. It usually consists of a local archive augmented by
frequently updated copies of remote archives. The local archive is
maintained on the local computer, whereas the remote archives are
maintained on other computers. We call a frequently updated copy of
one archive on a remote site a "mirror". There is no need for every site
will need to mirror every archive in the system. Some may only mirror
bibliographic information rather than the papers to conserve disk
space. Others may mirror all the files of an archive. Others will
mirror only parts of a few archives.
<p>All archives hold papers and metadata about papers, as well as 
software that is useful to maintain archives. Everything contained
in an archive may be mirrored. For example, if the full text of a 
paper is in the archive, it may be mirrored. If the archive does
not wish the full text to be mirrored, it can store the papers outside
the archive, for example on a directory that does not belong to the
archive. 
<p>The Guildford protocol aims to find a set of minimal restrictions on
archives such that a global and local system will work.  A second key aim
of this document is to provide a set of rules such that if they are
followed locally, require almost no central effort. However a small amount
of work has to be provided by a central archive. This archive
is called the core archive. It contains ReDIF templates that describe
all known archives in the system. 
<p>A limitation of this document is that it will not deal with charging
money for metadata i.e. that the description of documents is free. 
Limiting the access to the documents themselves is possible but remains
outside of the scope of the document.
<p>A second limitation is that the protocol does not deal with archiving
and preservation issues. A key feature of the protocol is that each
document has exactly one home site. If the home site withdraws the
document it is withdrawn (after a short delay) on all site that
maintain copies of the document.
<p>A third limitation of this document is that it applies only to
archives that contain series of documents. It is not intended to apply
to homepage style publications.
<p>The last limitation is that the protocol is not concerned with
providing end user services. For example the protocol does not provide
any ideas on how to present documents on a web server, how documents
should be indexed etc. However one of the key features of the protocol
is that software used to perform these task can be written by a
community of contributors and distributed among sites for
the benefits of everybody. There may be a
variety of software tools written to render the data in all sorts of
ways, to prepare all sorts of indexes, fire up a number of search
tools etc. At the moment many archives are trying hard to tackle these
issues on their own for their local needs. The usage of the protocol
will go a long way towards eliminating this multiplication of effort.

<h2>2: Definitions and conventions</h2>
<p>The "authority" is a group of people that have come together to
implement the Guildford protocol on a set of documents and metadata.
"RePEc" is an authority that supports the creation and deployment of
ReDIF data in economics according to the Guildford protocol.  For the
rest of the document, we will use the name "RePEc" to refer to the
authority.
<p>"<a href="ReDIF.html">ReDIF (Research Document Information Format)</a>" 
is a set of rules to encode information about papers, series, and 
copying rights. It is discipline independent and independent of 
an organisational structure
that supports its creation and deployment.
<p>A "series" is a collection of documents that are kept together. 
<p>An "archive" is a
directory on a computer that is open to access by ftp or http. It
holds a collection of series of papers or a collection of data
about papers held elsewhere.  
<p>A "RePEc archive" carries data
formated in ReDIF that pertain to Economics and use RePEc as
administrator.  It may also carry the full text of the documents.
<p>A "site" is a collection of (normally one) local archive plus any
number of mirrored archives. For the purpose of identification, sites
and archives are treated identical. Normally each site runs on archive
and mirrors several others.
<p>The "core archive" is a single machine on which a limited number of 
important files are kept.  These include the documentation of the
protocol, including the regulations of the decision making process,
brief descriptions of all the software contributed to the organisation
and the core templates (see <a href="ReDIF.html">the ReDIF documentation</a>) of all participating archives. The contents of the core
site is made available on all other sites.
<p>The "administrator" is the person who keeps the core files on the core
site.
<p>A "site" is a local archive complemented by mirrored copies
of remote archives. It offers end-user facilities.
<p>"mirroring" is a process by which copies of series of documents are
made from one site to another, such that the contents of the archive
is the same on all sites except for a short delay that is inevitable.

<h2>3: Introduction to implementation</h2> 
<p>Two pieces of software that are crucial for the implementation of the
project are the ftp or/and http protocol. The data is stored on
sites that are accessible via either those protocols, but we recommend
to use ftp.  To manage the sites, we have developed perl scripts.
Perl is available freely for a variety of platforms but it most
popular on unix machines. Initially the software will be designed with
unix machines in mind. We will consider other platforms when they
become available.
<p>To enable the software to work, we will need to impose a minimum of
structure on archive. That is detailed in <a href="guilp.html#site">Section
<a href="guilp.html#site">3.1</a></a>. For the provision of software for all servers, we
need a fix some rules that are detailed in <a href="guilp.html#soft">Section
<a href="guilp.html#soft">3.2</a></a>.
<p>The central site ALL operates at
<a href="ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all">ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all</a>.  Its archive code is ALL.
It provides the <a href="ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/soft/mirror">mirror</a> and the
<a href="ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/soft/webcopy">webcopy</a>
perl scripts that are used to mirror, the former for ftp archives, the
latter for the http archives. For ftp archives
<a href="ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/conf/allarch.mir">ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/conf/allarch.mir</a> provides
a file that mirrors all the ftp archives. 
<a href="ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/docu">ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/docu</a> contains all the
documentation. Finally <a href="ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/">ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/</a> mirrors the core
templates of all archives.
<p><a name="l4"></a>
<h3>3.1: The site</h3><a name="site"></a>
<p>A site contains a set of files. All names of files are case-insensitive.
The convention is that all archive identifiers have three
letters, all series identifiers 6 letters, 
the reserved words have four letters. Archive identifiers are
awarded by RePEc, the series identifiers are fixed by the
archives in consultation with RePEc, and the reserved words
are those mentioned in the protocol. All files ending
with the extension <code>.rdf</code>, pronounced "ReDIF" are files
that contain ReDIF templates. 
<p>If a site runs on a multi-user machine, it is recommended to create a
special account "adrepec" for the account. The following files can
then live in the home directory of the user "adrepec", or better, in a
subdirectory <code>RePEc</code> of this account that points to a space in the
files system that is accessible via anonymous ftp. In the following
we assume that we are in this subdirectory and we are looking
at the files and directories that it contains. 
<p><code>./</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>/</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>arch.rdf</code>
 a file describing the archive using a single ReDIF archive template
 (mandatory)
<p><code>./</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>/</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>seri.rdf</code>
 a file describing the series in the archive using a sequence of
 ReDIF series templates. All series in the archive are described
 in this file, one template for each series.
 (mandatory)
<p><code>./</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>/</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>serv.rdf</code>
 a file describing the services that the site is offering
<p><code>./</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>/</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>mirr.rdf</code>
 a file describing the mirroring arrangement of the
 site, using the ReDIF-mirror template
<p><code>./</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>/</code><em>series_identifier</em><code>/</code>
 a directory wfor papers and metadata for the series that is 
 identified by
 <em>series_identifier</em> are stored.
 All files that that pertain to the series <em>series_identifier</em>
 must be stored in that directory.  There must be at least one series directory
 on each server.  Files that  contain
 ReDIF information are called ReDIF files. Their names 
 must end in <code>.rdf</code>, but otherwise the structure of the
 directory is free.  You may put all templates for all papers in 
 the series in one file or you may put each paper template in a different file,
 just do as you please.  It is good pratice to start each ReDIF file in the
 directory with the <em>series_identifier</em>. 
<p><code>.</code>/<em>archive_identifier</em><code>/inst/</code>
  a place to store ReDIF files that contain institution templates. 
  See the <a href="RePEc/ReDIF.html">ReDIF</a> draft for further informaiton
  about that template.
<p><code>.</code>/<em>archive_identifier</em><code>/soft/</code>
 software that is written locally. For example, an archive may
 wish to write a specific procedure by which its ReDIF-Paper data is 
 translated into html. 
<p><code>.</code>/<em>archive_identifier</em><code>/conf/</code>
  location of configuration files for software. It does not
  matter whether the software is supplied by the local
  archive or a  remote
  archive. 
<p><code>./remo/</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>/</code>
 This is a strong suggestion (in the sense that some software
 may not work if you to not follow it) 
 where to put information from a remote archive
 <em>archive_identifier</em>. A  site does not need to mirror all the files 
 from a remote archive. It  must mirror the archive templates of the remote
 archive. It may then select series to mirror, or  only mirror 
 the <code>rdf</code> files.  
<p>For any archive, the collection of 
<code>./</code><em>archive_identifier</em><code>/</code><em>archive_identifier????</em><code>.rdf</code>
where <em>????</em> is either <code>arch</code>, <code>seri</code>, <code>serv</code> or <code>mirr</code>
are called its core templates. They are mirrored on the
core site. 
<p>Each site may mirror a number of series from any number of archives. 
If any site mirrors any series for an archive, it may 
mirror the complete subdirectories of the series or all
ReDIF files (ending with <code>.rdf</code>) of the series. 
If an archive does not wish the papers to be mirrored,
then it will store them out of this hierarchy.

<h3>3.2: Providing software</h3><a name="soft"></a>
<p>Archives may provide software for other archives to use. Services are
encouraged to provide software that allows the construction of
identical services on many sites.
<p>For the sake of simplicity of exposition, let us assume that there is
an archive "giv" that gives (provides) a software package called
"bambi", and an archive "tak" that takes (uses) the software locally.
A software packages is a set of software files that together perform
a particular function. 
All software is written in <a href="http://www.perl.com/perl/">perl</a>. All
scripts assume that perl lives in <code>/usr/bin/perl</code> to allow direct
use. Thus all scripts starts with <code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code>. 
<p>Software is provided in the <code>./giv/soft</code> directory. Software written
at the local site will be found in the <code>./giv/soft/RePEc</code> directory,
all other software is placed in other subdirectories of
<code>./giv/soft</code>. For example, the ALL archive provides mirror and
webcopy, two sets of scripts to mirror ftp and http based archives
respectively. These scripts are used in scripts provided by ALL.
<p>The file <code>./giv/soft/RePEc/bambi</code> is the main executable. Names of
other files start with 'bambi' (e.g. <code>bambi.README</code>) or be placed in
directory <code>./giv/soft/RePEc/bambi/</code> in order to distinguish which
file belongs to which packages. Scripts used by various programmes
are called
<code>./giv/soft/RePEc/soft/giv.*</code> or are placed 
<code>./giv/soft/RePEc/soft/giv/</code>.
<p>All scripts at start perform some general procedures to ensure their
portability (between different sites and environments) and general
rules of usage.
<p>They first check for command-line options <code>--rdir </code><em>directory_name
<code></code></em> and
<code>--conf </code><em>filename</em><code></code>)
to allow user to set her or his RePEc-archive
directory (which ends with archive identifier) and chose a programm
configuration file name (instead of default) respectively. The latter
is not necessary if programme does not use a configuration file.
<p>If <code>--rdir</code> option is not given, then programme checks environment
variable <code>REPECDIR</code> for RePEc-archive home directory. If it is not
set, then it assumes, that current directory is RePEc directory of the
local archive.  Keep in mind that some Perl functions in your script
may require absolute path of RePEc directory, thus a simple <code>./</code>
may  be too simple.
<p>If RePEc-archive home directory was received through a command-line
option or as environment variable, it should be checked whether such a
directory exists at all, and whether it ends with a three letter
sequence, which is supposed to be the local archive identifier. Under
Unix scripts should be aware of the optional trailing backslash.
<p>In <a href="ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/soft/RePEc/guilp_use_perl.eg">ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/all/soft/RePEc/guilp_use_perl.eg</a>
we show you just an
example of Perl code to implement this algorithm, which was written by
<a href="http://gretel.econ.surrey.ac.uk/%7eivan">Ivan Kurmanov</a>. You are
welcome to adapt it in your programmes. Ivan welcomes comments and
suggestions.
<p>Some scripts need to be installed before use by the end user. In that
case the installation script is <code>./giv/RePEc/bambi.in</code>, again with
a configuration example <code>./tak/bambi.in.conf</code>. The installation
script could be run again each time the software has been mirrored or
each time an service provider wishes to update the version of the
script in use at the archive. The latter should be a more secure way
to update scripts.
