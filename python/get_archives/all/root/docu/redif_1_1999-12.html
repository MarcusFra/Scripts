<h2>1: Introduction</h2> 
<p>This document describes version 1 of the Research Documents Information
Format (ReDIF). ReDIF is a metadata format to describe the output aspects
of academic disciplines. But that we mean the scientific documents that are
produced, the channels through which they are made public, the authors that
produce the papers and the editors that control the output channels, etc as
well as the institutions that support this process. Subsequent versions
will extend the capabilities of version 1. Data of version 1 will still be
able to be understood by processing software that will implement future
versions.
<p>This document is outdated.  It is available in PDF format for
<a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/.papers/redif_1_1999-12.letter.pdf">US letter size
paper</a>
and for <a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/.papers/redif_1_1999-12.a4.pdf">A4 size
paper</a>
. 
The current versions are available in PDF format for
<a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/.papers/redif_1.letter.pdf">US letter size
paper</a>
and for <a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/.papers/redif_1.a4.pdf">A4 size
paper</a>
.  All versions
are  in the public domain. You are encouraged to distribute it to your
friends and colleages.  We hope that the collection of data that are
encoded using ReDIF will also be in the public domain.  Get in touch
with the maintainer if wish to use ReDIF. Working together is more fun
and more productive than working on your own.
<p>ReDIF is shipped with software that allows to validate the syntax of its
argument. For example, any date has to be of the form
<em>yyyy-mm-dd</em>. "1999-07" is a valid date, whereas "Juillet 1999" is
not a valid date. Therefore ReDIF is well suited for the decentralized
maintenance of metadata.
<p>In principle, ReDIF should be syntax independent; and we are working on a
way to express ReDIF in a completely syntax independent way. 
The verison 1 is not
syntax independent.  In this document we only describe a template syntax
for ReDIF.  This is a simple "<em>field</em>: <em>value</em>" data format inspired
from the IAFA templates. A primitive nesting structure syntax is enabled
through the use of clusters of fields. The default character set for ReDIF
is ISO-8859-1. This is close to what is called Latin-1 on most machines and
close enough to the standard Windows character set. It is also the
character set that is used in the Hypetext Transfer Protocol (http).
<p>ReDIF is a relational metadata format. Each record has an identifier, also
called a "handle". Elements in one record may use the identifier of
another record. This allows elements to refer to other elements. A simple
example should be sufficient. An author may have written several papers. She
would like to have her email available within the data for each
paper. But if the phone number changes, there are changes required to all
the records for all papers that the author has written. That is
cumbersome. Instead, it is better to group all the personal data into one
record, and use the handle of that record whenever personal data is
required. The email address then only needs to be changed at one
place. ReDIF explicitly allows for that. 
<p>Note that examples in this document are mostly fictitious. All
similarity with the real world should be understood as a coincidence.

<h2>2: The ReDIF templates</h2>
<p><a name="l3"></a>
<h3>2.1: The template types</h3>
<p>ReDIF allows to describe things in the world that are important
to the work of an academic discipline. We will use the word
"item" to refer to any such things. ReDIF
allows to catalogue the following types of item. 
<p>
<p><center><table width=ll% border=0>
<tr> 

<td align=left> <em>item name</em> </td> 

<td align=left> <em>concern</em> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-paper </td> 

<td align=left> a research report that is not formally published <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-article </td> 

<td align=left> a research report in a scientific journal <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-chapter </td> 

<td align=left> a research report in a book <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> book </td> 

<td align=left> a book <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> software </td> 

<td align=left> an executable software or a software script <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> series </td> 

<td align=left> describes a series of templates of the items above <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> institution </td> 

<td align=left> an institution, e.g. a reseach centre <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<tr> 

<td align=left> person </td> 

<td align=left> a person, who could be an editor of a paper, editor
of a journal etc. <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

 
<br>
</table></center> 

<p>In addition, ReDIF knows about a number of templates that
are internal to its operation. 
<p>The ReDIF format splits all the information concerning a document into
a set of data elements. By data element we mean an elementary piece of
information that we do not wish to split further. The whole set of
data elements that describe an object forms the bibliographic record
or "template" of this object. "Attribute" and "field" are two synonyms
for a data element. "Record" is a synonym for a template.
<p>Templates or records are stored in files. Each file can contain one or
more templates. But one template cannot be separated into several
files.
<p>The ReDIF templates aim to compromise between human and machine
readability. The general syntax for a field is
<p><em>data_element_name</em><code>:  </code><em>data element value</em>
<p>where <em>data_element_name</em> would for example be
<code>Author-Workplace-Phone</code> and the data element value would be
<code>+44 1483 876958</code>.  Of course we could split the telephone
number into an international dialling code, a city code and a local
code, but that would go beyond what our data is actually needed for.
The field name must be separated from the field value by a colon and
optional whitespace. By a whitespace we mean a space character or a
tabulation character or any combination of those.
<p>Any field value may be continued (or even started) on the next line by
adding a whitespace at the beginning of the continuing
line. Multi-line data element values are delimited by the first line
which does not have a whitespace character in the first position, or
is blank. Thus all lines containing data element names should have no
whitespace characters in the beginning of the line.
<p>As a general rule, all whitespace characters that intends to signal
the continuation of a field value are to be collapsed into a blank
space character by processing software.
For example,<pre>
Title: Ecological outcomes
       of economic progress of
       mankind in last 100 years.
       Critical review.
</pre>

is a correct.
<p>All data element names may contain only alphanumeric characters, the
hyphen ("-") and hash sign ("#"). No embedded spaces are allowed. All
data element names are case insensitive. For readability we prefer
that the initial letters are capitalised for better human
readability).
<p>Any attribute that starts with <code>X-</code> is considered to be local,
and generally may be ignored by anyone.
It may be used by template writers to store any additional information. 
<p>
<p>Many attributes may be repeated within one record, 
but repetitions are discouraged and for some fields they are
prohibited. But for example, here is a person that works in two places:
<pre>
Author-Name: Sturm, J.F.
Author-Workplace-Name: Erasmus University Rotterdam,
       Econometric Institute 
Author-Workplace-Name: Center for Economic Policy Research
</pre>

But again, please avoid repeating attributes.
<p><a name="l4"></a>
<h3>2.2: Order of attributes in the template</h3>
<p>The ReDIF format requires some ordering requirements on the attributes
within the templates.  Some information has to be kept together. In that
case of several authors, each having different affiliations, the
affiliation of each author have to be kept with the author
information. More generally, some data elements have to be 
kept together. We call such a group of data elements a
cluster and discuss it in <a href="redif_1_1999-12.html#clusters">Section <a href="redif_1_1999-12.html#clusters">3</a></a>.
Each cluster has to start with a specific field. Similarly
each template has to start with a Template-Type declaration.
<p><a name="l5"></a>
<h3>2.3: Template Types</h3>
<p>All ReDIF templates must start with the <strong>Template-type</strong> field.  The
value of this field has important meaning - it indicates what type of
resource will be described by this template. Therefore, set of
expected fields in the template itself depends on that value. The
following are allowed at the moment.
<p>
<p><center><table width=lcl% border=0>
<tr> 

<td align=left> <em>Name</em> </td> 

<td align=center> <em>Version</em> </td> 

<td align=left> <em>used for</em> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 


<p><tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-Paper </td> 

<td align=center> <em>1.0</em> </td> 

<td align=left> individual documents <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-Article </td> 

<td align=center> <em>1.0</em> </td> 

<td align=left> documents in a journal <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-Chapter </td> 

<td align=center> <em>1.0</em> </td> 

<td align=left> documents in a book <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-Series </td> 

<td align=center> <em>1.0</em> </td> 

<td align=left> series of documents <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-Archive </td> 

<td align=center> <em>1.0</em> </td> 

<td align=left> archives of series of documents <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> ReDIF-Mirror </td> 

<td align=center> <em>1.0</em> </td> 

<td align=left> mirrors of archives of series of documents <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

 
<br>
</table></center> 

<p>Each template type has also a version number. That version 
number must be quoted after the template type. The version
number will make it easier to implement changes to ReDIF.
At the moment all template types are in version 1.0. 
<p>Use: <pre>
Template-Type: ReDIF-Archive 1.0
...

</pre>

<p>Any data that does not start with a correct <strong>Template-Type</strong>:
declaration will be ignored.
<p><a name="l6"></a>
<h2>3: Clusters</h2> <a name="clusters"></a>
<p>There are some sets of data elements in all template types, which are
common in several cases.  For example each file on the Internet has
it's URL (Internet-address), it's content is presented in some
specific format, and several different files can represent different
parts the whole document.  For example, each person mentioned in any
template may have a phone number, postal address, and probably works
for some organizations and so on.  Similarly, each organization has
it's specific name, address, phone number etc.
<p>We decided that these three cases (persons, organisations
and files) are more or less universal, so we
use the concept of "clusters of attributes" for these cases. 
<p>A cluster of attributes is a set of logically tied
fields in a template about one particular subject or object. Clusters
are in fact like small templates, which can be used inside real
(bigger) templates. For example, if we have a template of type
"ReDIF-Paper 1.0", it usually would contain a cluster (or several
clusters) with information about the author(s) of the paper, and one
or several clusters with information about the files of the paper,
available on the Internet (if there are any). 
<p>Each type of clusters has it's own structure (attributes). Like
templates, clusters must always start with one particular field, "key"
field. Each cluster has it's own key field.  The use of the key field
is independent on which template the cluster is used in. It is also
independent from the place where cluster is used in.  We say that it
is independent on the context.
<p>A cluster cannot be mixed with other attributes, which do not relate
to this particular cluster. So you should always keep one cluster's
attributes together. You can however nest clusters, for example
start an organisation cluster to describe the organisation an
author is affiliated with, within the cluster of this particular
author. 
<p>In fact, it's all not so complicated as it may seem. Let's look at
some examples to make things clear. Here is a simple cluster of type
"Person" which describes an author
<p><pre>
Author-Name: Joe Smith
Author-Email: JoeSmith@some.uni.edu
Author-Postal: PO Box 123, Smith Street, Somewhere In The, Universe, 987654 
Author-Phone: +99 456-321123
Author-Homepage: http://www.some.where.edu/~JoeSmith
</pre>

<p>Here is a cluster of type "Organization" describing a provider of a series
of papers:
<pre>
Provider-Name: Central Publishing House
Provider-Phone: ...
Provider-Fax: ...
Provider-Homepage: http://...
</pre>

<p>When we want to show you that you can use some cluster type a
template, we will use a syntax like <strong>Author-(PERSON*)</strong>,
<strong>Provider-(ORGANIZATION*)</strong>, <strong>File-(FILE*)</strong> etc. 
<p>Thus the clusters below in this document often join an attribute
prefix, e.g. "Author-", with a  cluster type name, e.g. "(PERSON*)",
between parenthesis. 
<p>When writing clusters you should always remember about 
putting the key field first. For example,
if you write 
<pre>
Template-Type: ReDIF-Paper 1.0
Title: The Capital
Author-Email: K.Marx@highgate.london.uk
Author-Name: Karl Marx
Author-Phone: ...
</pre>

<p>the <strong>Author-Email</strong>: attribute is not recognised,
because at that
point the <strong>Author-(PERSON*)</strong> cluster has not yet started.
This will  result
in an error message or in your template being ignored.
 But the <strong>Author-Name</strong>: field that follows will start the cluster,
because "Name" is the key field of the PERSON cluster. Hence
<strong>Author-Phone</strong>: field will be correctly processed.
<p>Another example of potential mistakes is a case, when there are
several objects to be described by a cluster type. Imagine
that we have  two
editors for a series
<pre>
Editor-Name: Adam Smith
Editor-Name: David Ricardo
Editor-Email: Adam.Smith@classical.econ.org
Editor-Email: David.Ricardo@classical.econ.org
Editor-Workplace-Name: Institute of Classical Economics
</pre>

<p>Looking at this data you can easily find out that Smith's email
address is <code>Adam.Smith@classical.econ.org</code> and that he
probably works for the Institute of Classical Economics as Ricardo
does. But computer wouldn't.
For the computer, the line <code>Editor-Name: David Ricardo</code> has started
a new <strong>PERSON</strong> cluster, so it will eventually contain all the rest
information you gave, including the email address of Smith. 
This mistake will not be identified as by any software only 
a human can find this mistake. 
<p>We believe that it's enough for you to understand the general
principles of clusters.  We will fill in the details now.
<p><a name="l7"></a>
<h3>3.1: The ORGANIZATION and PERSON clusters</h3>
<p>The <strong>ORGANIZATION</strong> cluster is defined by the following attributes:
<p><center><table width=ll% border=0>
<p><tr> 

<td align=left> <em>Name</em> </td> 

<td align=left> <em>Description</em> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 


<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Name </td> 

<td align=left> Name of organization, <strong>the key</strong> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Name-English </td> 

<td align=left> English translation of the name of organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Postal </td> 

<td align=left> Postal Address of organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Location </td> 

<td align=left> Name of place where organisation is based, e.g. "Harare" <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Email </td> 

<td align=left> Electronic mail address(es) of organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Phone </td> 

<td align=left> Telephone number(s) of organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Fax </td> 

<td align=left> Fax number(s) of organization <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Homepage </td> 

<td align=left> URL of organisation's home page <br></td> 

 
</tr> 


 
<br>
</table></center> 

<p><strong>Name</strong> is the key attribute of the organization cluster. It should
always be put first. 
<p>If you need example of organization cluster (where the
organisation is in fact a provider): 
<pre>
Provider-Name:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
Provider-Homepage: http://www.bog.frb.fed.us/pubs/feds/1996/ 
Provider-Email: fedspapers@frb.gov 

</pre>

<p>The <strong>PERSON</strong> cluster is used to describe Homo Sapiens.
<p>
<p><center><table width=ll% border=0>

<tr> 

<td align=left> <em>Name</em> </td> 

<td align=left> <em>Description</em> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 


<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Name </td> 

<td align=left> Name of person, <strong>the key</strong> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Workplace-(ORGANIZATION*) </td> 

<td align=left> Organization in which person works <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Email </td> 

<td align=left> Electronic mail address(es) of person <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Fax </td> 

<td align=left> Fax number(s) of person <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Postal </td> 

<td align=left> Postal address of person <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Phone </td> 

<td align=left> Telephone contact information <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Homepage </td> 

<td align=left> URL of person's home page <br></td> 

 
</tr> 


 
<br>
</table></center> 

<p><strong>Name</strong> is the key attribute of the person cluster. It should
always be put first. 
<p>Clusters can be nested, e.g., the  (PERSON*) cluster
can have a Workplace-(ORGANIZATION*) cluster inside it, as
we illustrated in the Adam Smith example earlier. 
<p><a name="l8"></a>
<h3>3.2: The FILE cluster</h3><a name="filecluster"></a>
The <strong>FILE*</strong> cluster is used to describe a file that contains
the resource that is being described, or a part of it. 
<p><center><table width=ll% border=0>

<tr> 

<td align=left> <em>Name</em> </td> 

<td align=left> <em>Description</em> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 


<p><tr> 

<td align=left> URL </td> 

<td align=left> Uniform Resource Locator of file, <strong>the key</strong> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Format </td> 

<td align=left> The format, e.g. "application/pdf" for PDF files, <strong>mandatory</strong> <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Function </td> 

<td align=left> explains the function of file within the resource <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Size </td> 

<td align=left> The file size, by default in kilobytes <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p><tr> 

<td align=left> Restriction </td> 

<td align=left> A restriction placed on accessing the file <br></td> 

 
</tr> 

<p>
 
<br>
</table></center> 

<p>These attributes may be not so trivial as in previous clusters, so
we'll describe each of them now.
<p><strong>URL</strong>: This is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the file on the
Internet. The URL identifies an access protocol and a code that this
protocol can use to retrieve the resource. Please refer to
<a href="http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/rfc/rfc1738.txt">http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/rfc/rfc1738.txt</a> when composing a URL. 
Any whitespace in
the URL will be ignored. Following RFC1783 any whitespace that follows
a dash character '-' is considered to be a mistake, because it is
likely to have been introduced by word processing software. The 
URL can be written over several lines, but do not break it after a
dash.  Use: <pre>
File-URL:
  http://www.hhs.se/research/wpecofi/papers/wp0121.pdf.zip ...
File-URL: ftp://crefe.dse.uqam.ca/pub/cahiers/cah44.ps
</pre>

<p>This is the key attribute of the file cluster. It should
always be put first. 
<p><strong>Format</strong>:  The contents of this field (all valid values) is restricted by
a controlled 
vocabulary, with the MIME Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions types. 
These types are specified in the
RFC1521 at <a href="http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/rfc/rfc1521.ps.gz">http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/rfc/rfc1521.ps.gz</a>.
<a href="ftp://venera.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types">One complete and up to date list of these types is maintained by the IANA 
Internet Assigning Number Authority</a>.
But we have added some more types to the list since MIME does not cover all the formats that we have in the database. The format of this field's value is: 
<p><code>File-Format: </code><strong>type</strong><code>/</code><strong>subtype</strong>[<code>/</code><em>subsubtype1</em>][<code>/</code><em>subsubtype2</em>]
<p>Here square brackets indicate that the expression inside is optional.  
<p><strong>type</strong>:  The type will be one of <code>text</code>, <code>application</code> or <code>image</code>.
<p><strong>subtype</strong>: The subtype is related to the type. 
When <strong>type</strong> is <strong>text</strong> we have:<pre>
text/plain 
text/html 
text/tex 
text/latex 
text/bibtex
</pre>

When the  the <strong>type</strong> is <code>application</code> we have: <pre>
application/pdf 
application/postscript 
application/msword 
application/wordperfect 
application/dvi 
application/lotus 
application/chiwriter 
application/gauss 
application/amipro 
application/mathematica 
application/rtf
application/envoy
application/quattropro
application/eps
application/vnd.ms-excel
application/hp
application/fortran
application/bin
application/prn
</pre>

When the <strong>type</strong> is <code>image</code> we have: <pre>
image/jpeg
image/gif
image/tiff
</pre>

<p>They are open lists that will be completed when documents with new formats 
will appear. If you wish to use a new type, please mail to the current
author of this document. 
<p><code>/</code><em>subsubtype1</em> &amp; <em>subsubtype2</em>: To enumerate if the file is
compressed and/or taped in some way. If one version is compressed and
taped the file format will need two subsubtype parts. The
<em>subsubtype</em> is optional. All files must have one type and subtype,
but they may not have a subsubtype. The subsubtypes can be:
<p><code>zipped</code>: zip files are the most popular compressed files 
on the Internet. Usually they have the
extension .zip
<p><code>gnuzipped</code>: This is a gzip (GNU zip) file format. zip and gzip are two 
different programmes, although the actual compression and decompression 
sources were written by the same people. zip is an archiver: it compresses 
several files into a single archive file. gzip is a simple compressor: each 
file is compressed separately. On Unix, gzip is mostly useful in combination
with tar. Usually they have the extension .gz. 
<p><code>unixcompressed</code>:  Compressed with the standard  Unix compress utility;
usually they have the extension .Z. 
<p><code>taped</code>: an archive produced by the Unix <code>tar</code> utility.  Tar is not
a compression programme. It is used in Unix machines and provides a
way to store many files in a single archive, which can be kept in
another Unix file. Usually the archive has the extension .tar.
<p>The subsubtypes can be combined: 
<pre>
 .../zipped 
.../gnuzipped 
.../gnuzipped/taped 
.../unixcompressed 
.../mac-binhex40
.../unixcompressed/taped
</pre>

<p>The attribute <strong>Format</strong>: is not repeatable and is case-insensitive.
<p><strong>Function</strong>: This is the function of the file. It should be used when a file 
represents only some part of the whole document (or resource). And the field
value indicates what particular part of the document is represented. For
example, use:
<pre>
File-Function: Appendix 1
...
File-Function: Main text 
...
File-Function: Example programme 
</pre>

If the file is a complete rendering of the resource, the <code>File-Function</code>
field should not be used. The field is not repeatable within the 
description of the same file. 
<p><strong>Size</strong>: The file size, by default in kilobytes. 
This attribute is not repeatable. Use: 
<pre>
File-Size: 48
...
File-Size: 1788984 bytes
</pre>

<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: A restriction on the retrieval of a file. If the
file can be retrieved by anybody with Internet access without
any preliminary payment or registration, you should
<strong>not</strong> use that field at all. Please do not use the field to make
recommendations of the type "please use outside working hours", since
as soon as there is a restriction on the file many services will be
assuming that there is no public access to the file. If all files
of a document are restricted, please use the field <strong>Restriction</strong>: in the
template of the resource, rather than repeating it for each file
of the resource.

<p><strong>Author-(PERSON*)</strong>: This cluster-field is used to describe the 
person(s) that has
created the document and is  mainly responsible for its intellectual
content. We recommend the name of the author(s) should be given in
normalised format like "Lastname, Firstname" but the direct order is
also acceptable.
<p>Omit titles, honours and others. If there are several authors, the
information should be repeated for each author. This field  is
mandatory.  That means that you should give at least one
<strong>Author-Name</strong>: field with some value in each ReDIF-Paper template. Other
information about the author is optional. Please do not overload the
templates with author information. Use:<pre>
Author-Name: Lang, William

<p><strong>Contact-Email</strong>: This field is used to describe the 
a person that is a contact for the paper. This does not
need to the be the author's email. You should not supply
this field if you already have the author email. In some
cases where the author does not wish her email to be
in the paper information, this field should be used.
Use:<pre>

</pre>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: The name of the document being catalogued. This includes any 
subtitles. This is a required field. Use: <pre>
Title: A Theory of Gradual Trade Liberalisation
</pre>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This is the abstract of the document. Although we do
not require to have an abstract, but we strongly recommend to
provide a detailed abstract, because it increases the chance of users
finding your document within a full-text database. 
If you have a long abstract that has several paragraphs please
split the paragraphs by the html <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
sequence or repeat the  <strong>Abstract</strong>: field for each paragraph.
<p>
<p><strong>Classification-</strong><em>scheme</em>: 
This is the classification number associated with the document. The
<strong>scheme</strong> is a code for a  classification scheme. Allowed (registered)
classification schemes and codes are listed in 
<a href="redif_1_1999-12.html#claschemes">Section
<a href="redif_1_1999-12.html#claschemes">10.1</a></a>.
If you have documents, classified with some other scheme, just email us your
suggestion, and we will register your scheme. 
<p>If there are several
classification numbers of the same classification scheme, they will be
separated by a semicolon. This attribute is not repeatable, unless
there are multiple schemes used. Example:<pre>

Classification-JEL: C12; C30
</pre>

<p><strong>Keywords[-</strong><em>scheme</em><strong>]</strong>: These are keywords associated with the
text. If there are several keywords they will be separated by a
semicolon.  <em>Scheme</em> is the keywords scheme's code but it can also
be empty, to say that the
keywords do not follow 
a scheme. <strong>Keywords</strong>: should be used in that case.  If you have
some keywords schemes, we will register it for you in 
<a href="redif_1_1999-12.html#keyschemes">Section
<a href="redif_1_1999-12.html#keyschemes">10.2</a></a>.

Note: This paper was written 5 years ago and we haven't... 
</pre>

<p><strong>Length</strong>: The length of a printed version of the 
document, usually in pages. This attribute is not repeatable.
Use: <pre>
Length: 29 pages
</pre>

<p><strong>Series</strong>: This is the series of the document. You can simply name
the series here. In any case series
information may also be extracted from the series templates of the
core template files. This attribute is not repeatable.
<p><strong>Number</strong>: The number of the paper within the series. This attribute
is not repeatable.
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: This field can be used to state if a paper is out of
print. If the paper is on the net it should not be used. It can also
be used to say how the get hold of the copy of the paper.  This
attribute is not repeatable.  Use: <pre>
Availability: out of print
</pre>

<p><strong>Creation-Date</strong>: The date at which the original document was created. The
format should be as similar to the <em>ISO 8601:1988 Data elements and
interchange formats -- Information interchange -- Representation of
dates and times</em>
 as possible. This is <em>yyyy[-mm[-dd]]</em> where <em>yyyy</em> is the year, <em>mm</em> is
the month and <em>dd</em> is the day. The notation <em>yyyy[dd[mm]]</em> may also be used.
Note that the field should only contain the date of the creation,
no other information. This field is not repeatable. Use:
<pre>
Creation-Date: 1995-06-30 
</pre>

<p><strong>Revision-Date</strong>: A date at which the document was changed.
See previous paragraph for value format of this field - it is the same 
as in <strong>Creation-Date</strong>. This field may be repeated. 
<pre>
Revision-Date: 1995-06-30
</pre>

<p><strong>Price</strong>: That refers to the price of a printed copy of the document,
when ordered through the ordering channels specified in the 
series template.  
Use: 
<pre>
Price: $3.00 Surface, $4.00 Air (U.S. $)
Price: 15 guilders by mail, free by ftp 
</pre>

<p><strong>Publication-Status</strong>: This can be used 
 to say if a modified version of the document exists, has been
forthcoming, etc. in a commercial journal, book or other type of
formal publication. It should always start with the word "published"
or the word "forthcoming" (case insensitive). Use: 
<pre>
 Publication-Status: Forthcoming in
  Computational Statistics and Data 
Publication-Status: Published in Journal of Artificial Intelligence
   Research, Vol.3 
Publication-Status: Published in American Journal of Agricultural Economics,
  1995, vol. 77, no. 1. pp. 120-134.
Publication-Status: Published by University of Arizona Press 
</pre>

<p><strong>Handle</strong>: This is a required field in all cases. It's really important. 
The <strong>Handle</strong> field content starts with the name of the 
authority (organization), for example RePEc. 
The next element is a : and after that
follows the code of the archive, then code of the series finally the number
of the paper. All these parts are : separated. Note that this
field may not contain whitespace. If the <em>Handle</em> is written over
several lines, the processing software will eliminate 
the whitespace characters on the lines boundaries. Use: 
<pre>
Handle: RePEc:bon:bonnsf:a452 
Handle: RePEc:die:calsdi:9338 
Handle: RePEc:wop:censes:90-1
Handle: RePEc:wop:comadt:08 
Handle: RePEc:wop:fedhbs:_007
</pre>

<p>Each electronic document, described in RePEc system will have it's own
unique handle, which will allow to identify it (if we now the type
of the document, e.g. Paper).
<p><em>template_type</em><strong>-Handle</strong>: This attribute cannot
be used until we develop and introduce more template types
for different document types. But we will explain you idea for the future.
If there is a different version of a document and this new version
has been described using the ReDIF templates in some system (may be RePEc or
may be not), it is possible to provide a reference to this another 
variant of the document by use of this field. You just need to specify a 
template-type in the field and give a handle. For a example, imagine
that we have defined the ReDIF-Book template and we have a template of
a paper, which was later published as a book. And this book also got
to be described in a ReDIF template. Then just can include <strong>Book-Handle</strong>
field into the ReDIF-Paper template and supply the handle (value of the field
<strong>Handle</strong>) of the book. Restrictions on value of this field are the same like
in case of bh(Handle).
Use:
<pre>
Article-Handle: RePEc:chgooe:957701a
Book-Handle: RePEc:aripr038
</pre>

The resolution process of these handles is not yet clear. 
<p><strong>Notification</strong>: to specify how new versions of the paper are
announced.
<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: A restriction on the retrieval of a paper. This is
similar to the field of the same name in the File cluster. If the 
paper can be retrieved by anybody with internet access, you should
not use that field at all. Please do not use the field to make
recommendations of the type "please use outside working hours", since
as soon as there is a restriction on a paper many services will be
assuming that there is no public access to it.  If not all 
of the files that make up the paper are restricted, mention the
restriction only in the <strong>FILE</strong> cluster of the restricted.

Title:  Phases of Imitation and Innovation in a North-South Endogenous Growth
        Model
Abstract:  In this paper, we develop a North-South endogenous growth model to
  examine three phases of development in the South: imitation of Northern
  products, imitation and innovation and finally, innovation only.
  In particular, the model has the features of catching up (and
  potentially overtaking) which are of particular relevance to the Pacific Rim
  economies.  We show that the possible equilibria 
  depend on cross-country assimilation effects and the ease of
  imitation.  We then apply the model to analyse the impact of R&amp;D
  subsidies.  There are some clear global policy implications which emerge
  from our analysis.  Firstly, because subsidies to Southern innovation
  benefit the North as well, it is beneficial to the North to pay for some of
  these subsidies.  Secondly, because the ability of the South to assimilate
  Northern knowledge and innovate depends on Southern skills levels, the
  consequent spillover benefits on growth make the subsidising
  of Southern education by the North particularly attractive.

Abstract: This paper develops a Bayesian vector autoregressive model (BVAR)
        for the leader of the Portuguese car market to forecast the market
        share. The model includes five marketing decision variables.The
        Bayesian prior is selected on the basis of the accuracy of the out-
        of-sample forecasts. We find that our BVAR models generally produce
        more accurate forecasts of market share. The out-of-sample accuracy
        of the BVAR forecasts is also compared with that of forecasts from
        an unrestricted VAR model and of benchmark forecasts produced from
        univariate (e.g., Box- Jenkins ARIMA) models. Additionally,
        competitive dynamics of the market place are revealed through
        variance decompositions and impulse response analysis.

<h2>6: ReDIF templates for other publications</h2>
<p>If a paper has been published in a journal, as a book or as a chapter
in a book, you may wish to indicate that in the
<strong>Publication-Status</strong>: field of the ReDIF-Paper template.  The
templates that follow are provided for archives that wish to provide
more detailed information of the manifestations of a paper.  We only
give a summary of the meaning of the fields.  Most of the fields are
the same as in the ReDIF-Paper template and thus need no further
explanation.
<p>The templates in this section are considered draft templates.
<p><a name="l16"></a>
<h3>6.1: The ReDIF-Article Template</h3>
<p>An article is something that appeared in a journal or is forthcoming
in a journal. This is a draft template for such publications.
<p><strong>Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0</strong>   The template must start
with this field
<p>Other fields are like the paper template except that the
following are not valid: 
<p><strong>Length</strong>: <strong>Series</strong>: <strong>Availability</strong>: <strong>Price</strong>:
<strong>Revision-Date</strong>: <strong>Article-Handle</strong>:. Of course <strong>Paper-Handle</strong>: is
valid.
<p>There are the following extra fields that the ReDIF-Article field has
that are not in the ReDIF-Paper template. These are listed here.
<p><strong>Journal</strong>: Name of the journal, non-repeatable
<p><strong>Year</strong>: Year of publication,  non-repeatable
<p><strong>Pages</strong>: Pages in journal, non-repeatable
<p><strong>Volume</strong>: Volume article appears in, non-repeatable
<p><strong>Month</strong>: Month journal issue is published, non-repeatable
<p><strong>Handle</strong>: Handle of journal article. required.
<p>It is of the form
<p>RePEc:<em>archive_identifier</em>:<em>series_identifier</em>:<em>article_code</em>
<p>where <em>archive_identifier</em> is the 3 letter archive identifier,
<em>series_identifier</em> is the six letter identifier of a
series and :<em>article_code</em> is the article code. The archive
identifier should be the archive where the information is kept,
if that is not known put "jou".
<p>As far as the series identifier is concerned, only series of articles
are admissible here. In fact as far as ReDIF is concerned, a journal
is a nothing else than a series of articles. It therefore has a series
code like a paper series. It can be refereed to as a "journal code" in
casual language, but the reader should keep in mind that as far as the
structure of ReDIF is concerned the journal is nothing else than
a series. 
<p>The <em>article_code</em> is a concatenation of qualifiers, separated
by the colon character. Each qualifier is an  <em>attribute</em>:<em>value</em>
pair. The <em>attribute</em> is represented by one letter only
This is best understood by an example. 
<p>RePEc:xxx:joinec:v:19:y:1985:i:Q1:p:67-84
<p>The qualifiers currently defined are the following. We list
a name for the qualifier, the letter of the qualifier,
a description of values and a perl regular expression that
that can be used to verify the syntax of the qualifier, as
well as an optional additional check.
<p>Name: volume<br>
Letter: v<br>
Value: any sequence of digits<br>
RegEx: v[1-9][0-9]*<br>
<p>Name: issue<br>
Letter: i<br>
Value: any sequence of digits<br>
RegEx: i[1-9][0-9]*<br>
<p>Name: year<br>
Letter: y<br>
Value: any sequence of four digits<br>
RegEx: y:([1-9][0-9]{3})<br>
Check: warn if $1 is higher then current year or earlier than 1500<br>
<p>Name: pages <br><br>
Value: number of page where article starts - number of page where <br>
article ends<br>
RegEx: p:S*([1-9][0-9]*)-S*([1-9][0-9]*)<br>
Check: $1 should be smaller than $2<br>
<p>here the S stands for "supplement", just in case that the 
paper has not been published in the main issue. 
<p>Name: issue<br>
Value: which issue within the year. If the issue is a month, then
  we give the English three letter start of the month: JAN, FEB
  MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC. The numbers of the
  months are also allowed here, but that is discouraged. If the issue is a
  quarter, we use Q1, Q2 etc. If the issue has a start
  date, put that date like 04-01 for 1 April. Note that you need
  to put the - separator here because the date is otherwise mistaken
  to be the number of the issue.There is no need to put an end date
  for this issue. You can repeat the issue qualifier
  if the physical issue covers several logical issues. SPE can be
  added to say it is a special editions, and S can be 
  postponed for a supplement. 
RegEx: i:(($months\d*)($season[S]*)(Q[1234])(\d+)(\d\d-\d\d))
  where $monthe="(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)"
  and $season="(spr|sum|aut|win|spe)"

What happens if you wish to provide data about the 
formal publication, i.e., within a journal, of a paper for
which you have ReDIF-Paper information. This is called Sune's
problem. The basic status is that it is not possible for you
to provide information about an article that you have published
in a journal. It is for the journal or some agent of the journal
to provide that information, because all the information about
all the articles has to be kept together in once directory. However,
you can give the Article handle, and a ReDIF literate individual
should be able to find the information.

<h3>7.1: The ReDIF-Institution template</h3>
<p>This template concerns information about institutions. This information
can be used in the other templates by a call to the appropriate
institution handle. The template has to be in a directory called inst.
<p>The elements of the ReDIF-Institution template
<p>There are three types of clusters: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. This
is to take account of some institutions being subdivision of others.
Examples are: University of London/London School of Economics/Financial
Markets Group, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis/Research Department,
Government of Zambia/Ministry of Finance. These three clusters are
organized like the ORGANIZATION cluster described in section 3.1, with
the addition of Location and Name-English elements. An example is:<pre>

Primary-Name: Universite des Grands Espoirs
Primary-Name-English: University of Grand Hopes
Primary-Location: Panava-les-Flots
Secondary-Name: Departement d'Economie
Secondary-Name-English: Department of Economics
Secondary-Email: eco@uge.edu
Secondary-Homepage: http://www.eco.uge.edu/
Secondary-Phone: (+567)3466356

</pre>

<p>An additional element is:
<p><strong>Handle</strong>: This has to be a 7 letter handle, the last two characters being
the ISO 3166 country codes (us for the United States, ea foe associations
and societies). Archive edi (EDIRC) already has a lot of institutional
information. For updating information about an institution already listed
in EDIRC, please use the same handle! Information at other
archives overrides the information of the edi archive. Examples:<pre>

Handle: RePEc:edi:imfffus
Handle: RePEc:edi:mofgvzm
Handle: RePEc:fmg:fmlseuk
 
</pre>

Complete templates may therefore read:<pre>

Template-Type: ReDIF-Institution 1.0

Primary-Location: Manama
Secondary-Name: Bahrain Monetary Agency
Secondary-Homepage: http://www.bma.gov.bh/

<h2>8: The administrative templates</h2><a name="admintemplates"></a>
<p>These templates are not intended for the providers of 
archives. 
<p><a name="l23"></a>
<h3>8.1: The Mirror template</h3>
<p>The mirror template describes what kind of mirror you are running on
your machine. You are allowed to mirror any series and archive you
wish. What you are mirroring is described in the mirror template.  It
contains information that is read by the scripts that build your
mirror.
<p><strong>Template-type:</strong> <code>ReDIF-Mirror 1.0 </code> Each mirror template must
start with this declaration.
<p><strong>Archive-Handle</strong>: This is the archive identifier of your
archive. This is a mandatory field. Each mirror must belong to
an archive. 
<p><strong>User</strong>: For Unix machines only. This is the name the user that that
owns the archive. We recommend that you give that you use the name
"adrepec". This is also the default username.  Why the "ad" stands in
front of the "repec" is a long story that does not really belong here.
<p><strong>Group</strong>: For Unix machines only.
The name of the group of the user that that owns the archive.
The  default is "adrepec". 
<p><strong>Directory</strong>: The path for the directory of the mirror on your
machine, i.e. the place where the
directories of the archives live. The path can either be the full path
or a relative path from home of the user that owns the archive. Note
that this directory is not the RePEc directory where your own archive
lives, but the place where a series of remote archive directory lives.
We recommend that this path ends with <code>/remo</code>.
<p><strong>Description</strong>: any description that you may add to the information
about the mirror
<p><strong>Maintainer-Email</strong>: the email of somebody in charge of the mirror
(mandatory)
<p><strong>Maintainer-Phone</strong>: phone number of some person
 in charge of the mirror 
<p><strong>Maintainer-Fax</strong>: fax number of some person
 in charge of the mirror 
<p><strong>Maintainer-Name</strong>: the name of a person that is
in charge of the mirror.
<p><strong>Machine</strong>: The DNS name or number on which the mirror is running. This
is a mandatory field. 
<p>The next four fields should be handled with care. At most one
of them may appear. 
<p><strong>Archives-Included</strong>: a list of archives handles that are included in
the mirror. The list may be separated by any character except letters
and colons.  If this field does not appear, the mirror will include
all archives known to RePEc. If it appears, the mirror will include
only the series listed. Thus for example, if you leave that
attribute blank, the mirror will mirror nothing.
<p><strong>Archives-Excluded</strong>: a list of archives handles that are excluded in
the mirror. The list may be separated by any character except letters
and colons.  If this field does not appear, the mirror will include
all archives known to RePEc. If it appears, the mirror will exclude
the archives that are listed. Thus for example, if you leave that
attribute blank, the mirror will mirror everything. 
<p><strong>Series-Included</strong>: a list of series handles that are included in
the mirror. The list may be separated by any character except letters
and colons.  If this field does not appear, the mirror will include
all series known to RePEc. If it appears, the mirror will include
only the series listed. Thus for example, if you leave that
attribute blank, the mirror will mirror nothing. 
<p><strong>Series-Excluded</strong>: a list of series handles that are excluded in
the mirror. The list may be separated by any character except letters
and colons.  If this field does not appear, the mirror will include
all archives known to RePEc. If it appears, the mirror will exclude
the archives that are listed only the series listed. Thus for example,
if you leave that attribute blank, the mirror will mirror everything. 
<p><strong>ReDIF-only</strong>: This field may be used to tell mirroring 
software only to mirror files with the extension tt.rdf). 
The value of the field will be ignored. If you wish to 
mirror everything in an archive please do not use this field.

<h2>9: Data on secondary instances</h2> 
<p>Some metadata relating to preprints contain information on where the paper
has been published.  If a complete record for this instance is provided by
the publisher of the formal channel, a link to that record may be included
in the paper. However in most cases only partial and non-authoritative
information about this instance in available. If that data is just a chain
of characters, the <strong>Publication-Status</strong> field can be used. If that data
is itself fielded, the MANIFESTATION cluster should be used.
<p><a name="l26"></a>
<h3>9.1: The MANIFESTATION cluster</h3>
<p>Any instance where the resource or something very similar is formally
published is called a manifestation of the resource. The manifestation
cluster is used to deal with that.
<p><strong>Type:</strong> Each manifestation template must
start with this field. This field has a controlled vocabulary.
It can take the following values.
