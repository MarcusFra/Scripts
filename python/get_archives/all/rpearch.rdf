Description: The RESEARCH is founded on analyzing society in a manner consistent with classical Marxism. International in scope, the annual volumes deal primarily with economic and political issues and the unity between them. Both theoretical and empirical works are included. While published papers must be appropriate for developing class analysis of society, they need not be explicitly Marxist. The RESEARCH can accept papers up to 50 pages in print (on occasion, even longer) and thus is particularly appropriate for work which is not book length, yet is substantial. For submissions, please send your paper, double-spaced type with references as endnotes, to the editor either electronically or three copies to the postal address above. Usual practice is review by two competent persons, on a double-blind basis, within a relatively short period of time.
