Description: This archive collects discussion papers from the Technology Management, Economics, and Policy Program (TEMEP) of Seoul National University.
The Technology Management, Economics, and Policy Program (TEMEP) is a graduate program at Seoul National University. It includes both M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs, which are integrated into the graduate programs at the College of Engineering.
The TEMEP Discussion Paper Series is intended to serve as an outlet for publishing research about theoretical, methodological, and applied aspects of industrial economics, especially those related to the institute’s areas of specialization, namely management of technology, information and communication technology, telecommunication, services, health industries, energy industries, as well as infrastructures for development. In particular, paper submissions are welcome, which analyze current technology and industry related issues, discuss their implications, and suggest possible alternative policies. The objective is to gain insights into important policy issues and to acquire a balanced viewpoint of policy making, technology management, and economics. It will enable us to identify the problems in industries accurately and to come up with optimal and effective guidelines. In addition, another important aim of this series is to facilitate communication with external research institutes, individual researchers, and policy makers worldwide.
Research results disseminated by TEMEP may include views on policies for information and communication technologies, technology management, telecommunication, energy, health, and development economics, but the institute itself takes no institutional policy position. If appropriate, the policy views of the institute are disseminated in separate policy briefs. Thus, any opinion expressed in the TEMEP Discussion Paper Series is those of the author(s) and not necessarily the opinion of the institute.
