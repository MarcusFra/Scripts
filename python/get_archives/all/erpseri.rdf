Name: Queen's Papers on Europeanisation
Description: The Queens papers, originally published by the Institute of European
 Studies, are now published by the School of Politics and International Studies of
 the University of Queens in Belfast. The objective of the paper series is to contribute
 to the theoretical development and empirical exploration of 'Europeanisation' in a
 way that straddles disciplines and facilitates a dialogue between contending
 perspectives. Unidisciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and comparative
 papers on Europeanisation will be welcomed. It is envisaged that papers will explore
 topics such as the following:- conceptual definitions of Europeanisation;- relationships
 between Europeanisation, integration and globalisation;- the practice of Europeanisation,
 particularly problems of identification, measurement, causation, explanation and
 variation between sectors; and critical discussion of the progress and future of
 Europeanisation, having regard to problematic and contested notions of 'the unity
 and diversity of Europe'.
