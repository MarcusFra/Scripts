Name: International Journal of Decision Support System Technology (IJDSST)
Description: <p>The primary objective of the <b>International Journal of Decision Support System Technology (IJDSST)</b> is to provide comprehensive coverage for DMSS technology issues. The issues can involve, among other things, new hardware and software for DMSS, new models to deliver decision making support, dialog management between the user and system, data and model base management within the system, output display and presentation, DMSS operations, and DMSS technology management. Since the technology's purpose is to improve decision making, the articles are expected to link DMSS technology to improvements in the process and outcomes of the decision making process.</p><p>Decision Making Support Systems (DMSS) are information systems that interactively support the decision making process of individuals and groups in life, public, and private organizations, and other entities. These systems include Decision Support Systems (DSS), Executive Information Systems (EIS), Executive Support systems (ESS), Management Support Systems (MSS), Knowledge Based Systems (KBS), Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) and Creativity Enhancing Systems (CES). A theme that all articles published in the IJDSST have in common is to define new technologies in support of decision making. These technologies can be developed from several points of view: methodological, theoretical or technical.</p><p>Each DMSS is a vehicle that delivers effectively and efficiently information technology and decision technology to the system user at a local or networked workstation or online through the Internet. The areas addressed by published papers can be diverse, including but not limited to:architectures of DSS, functionalities, mathematical models ofproblem solving, algorithms, man-machine interface, methods or methodologies. Decision technology usually involves accounting, cognitive science, economic science, management science, statistical models, operational research models and multi-criteria analyses that describe the decision problem explicitly and provide algorithms and methodologies that generate recommended solutions.</p><p>There are a number of excellent theoretical and applied scholarly journals that offer articles in many DMSS areas. None, however, have a primary focus on DMSS technology and its role in DMSS support for the decision making process. The IJDSST is the official journal publication of the Euro Working Group on Decision Support System (EWG-DSS) (https://ewgdss.wordpress.com/). Several special issues have been published from research conducted in this working group.</p>

Name: Journal of Global Information Management (JGIM)
Description: <p>John Naisbitt, in his book, Global Paradox, says "the bigger the world economy, the more powerful its smaller players." Big international companies are deconstructing themselves and creating new structures to survive in the new world order. Concepts like reengineering, rightsizing, network organizations and the virtual corporation are fast becoming the common theme in business practice. International strategic alliances are also on the increase based on the notion that no single company and no single country can alone be a successful player in the new global game. The organizational applications and managerial implications of these technology resources warrant a forum for the discussion of these issues. The <b>Journal of Global Information Management (JGIM)</b> has an important role to play in providing such a forum for researchers and practitioners to share leading-edge knowledge in the global information resource management area.</p>

Description: <p>Global markets and competition have forced companies to operate in a physically distributed environment to take the advantage of benefits of strategic alliances between partnering firms. Earlier, information systems such as Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) have widely been used for functional integration within an organization. With global operations in place, there is a need for suitable Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and E-Commerce (EC) for the integration of extended enterprises along the supply chain with the objective of achieving flexibility and responsiveness. Companies all over the world spend billions of dollars in the design and implementation of EIS in particular ERP systems such as Oracle, Peoplesoft, SAP, JD Edwards and BAAN with the objective of achieving an integrated global supply chain. Inter-organizational information systems play a major role in improving communication and integration between partnering firms to achieve an integrated global supply chain. There is a growing demand for research and applications that will provide insights into issues, challenges, and solutions related to the successful applications and management aspects of EIS.</p>

Description: <p>The proliferation of Web-based technologies during the last decade may have given the impression of wide-spread changes in educational practices. In fact, we have only begun to scratch the surface of experiencing the vast impact these technologies could have on education. Viewed separately, Web-based technologies offer exciting possibilities for expanding the capacity to provide access to instruction and knowledge world-wide. However, and perhaps more importantly, viewing these technological advancements in a more dynamic context, forces educators and researchers to rethink the fundamental processes of teaching and learning . It's not just a simple matter of using a technical tool to supply time and place ubiquity but to accept the challenge of understanding the implications for the entire educational spectrum. Web-based teaching and learning begs the question of what exactly these technologies means for learners, teachers, program designers, academic experts, technical and administrative staff, institutional decision makers, training managers, publishers, and others. Although a considerable amount of exploration has been conducted regarding web-based learning technologies, the breadth and scope for dialogue and experimentation needs to be broadened. <b>International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies (IJWLTT)</b> provides a place for the dialogue and support of a diverse community interested in taking the challenge further.</p>

Name: International Journal of Adaptive, Resilient and Autonomic Systems (IJARAS)
Description: <p>The <b>International Journal of Adaptive, Resilient and Autonomic Systems (IJARAS)</b> examines systems and organizations characterized by the following two properties: the ability to self-adapt to the characteristics of rapidly changing and turbulent environments by adopting complex individual and social strategies and the ability to control their changes to prevent the invalidation of their original mission statements. The central focus of IJARAS is on modeling, simulating, designing, developing, maintaining, evaluating, and benchmarking such ‚Äúentelechial systems.‚Äù Perception, awareness, and the planning and execution of resilient adaptation behaviors in systems and organizations are central topics of the journal. Such systems range from individual and simple embedded systems with limited perception and predefined specialized behaviors to complex hybrid social organizations like cyber-physical societies or service-oriented communities, whose emerging behaviors are many and, in some cases, difficult to predict. IJARAS focuses on the full spectrum of these problems providing academicians, practitioners, and researchers with awareness and insight on conceptual models, applied and theoretical approaches, paradigms, and other technological innovations on self-adaptive and/or self-resilient systems and organizations of any scale and nature.</p>

Name: International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction (IJTHI)
Description: <p>An increasing amount of research is being done in the area where technology and humans meet. The success or failure of technologies, the question whether technology helps humans to fulfill their goals or whether it hinders them is in most cases not a technical one. Even though this problem has been recognized in many academic disciplines that deal with technology, we are still far from being able to present a set of theories that would allow us to understand the interaction of technology and humans and to put it to practical use. The <b>International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction (IJTHI)</b> aims to provide a platform for leading research that addresses issues of human and technology interaction. IJTHI seeks original contributions concerning any aspect of technology and human interaction dealing with the development, usage, failure, success, policies, strategies, and applications of them. The journal invites contributions from both scholars and practitioners involved in research, management, and the utilization of technology and human interaction.</p>

Name: International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education (IJICTE)
Description: <p>Ask any teacher at any level of education ‚Äì technology engages learners and animates their imagination. Technology stimulates minds in ways that make a profound and lasting difference. Indeed, technology, for many, is the most important new teaching strategy and learning style introduced in the past 50 years. Yet, the discipline is woefully lax in quantifiable and qualitative validation of successful learning outcomes. Learners with basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic master those skills better and faster with technology; yet the research is not there to defend how much better or how much faster these skills are acquired. Technology offers educators a way to adapt instruction to the needs of more diverse learners; still, such successes are not generalized across populations or content areas. Learners use technology to acquire and organize information evidence to obtain a higher level of comprehension; but we are not sure why. The purpose of the <b>International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education (IJICTE)</b> is to grow this body of research, propose new applications of technology for teaching and learning, and document those practices that contribute irrefutable verification of information technology education as a discipline.</p>
