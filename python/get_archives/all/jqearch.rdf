Description: THE JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE ECONOMICS (JQE) is a biannual refereed journal of the Indian Econometric Society. It is published in January and July each year. Authors are encouraged to submit papers in the areas of econometric theory, applied econometrics, mathematical economic theory, optimization techniques & operations research and cybernetics. The Journal also features Review Articles, Short Papers and Computer Algorithms. The editors particularly welcome innovative papers that focus on economic problems of emerging market economies and less developed countries. Applications of routine econometric packages to standard data sets are not of interest nor are papers of a purely mathematical nature with very little economic content. Authors are responsible for seeing that the material used in their papers is copy-right clear. The Editors disclaim any responsibility on this score. Electronic submission by email to nachane@igidr.ac.in or mythili@igidr.ac.in or rupayan@igidr.ac.in , with a copy to mohan@igidr.ac.in, is highly encouraged.
