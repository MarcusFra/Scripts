Name: The International Journal of Economic Behavior - IJEB
Description: This is one of the journals of the Faculty of Business and Administration, University of Bucharest. The International Journal of Economic Behavior aims to publish research articles (both quantitative and qualitative), reports from the field, critical review paper, discussions concerning the main characteristics of the economic behavior and, consequently, decision and organization. Moreover, the journal seeks to discuss the manner in which some of the classical theoretical statements, practices and policy making in Economics, Business and Management are influenced by factors which are not proven to fit the well / known hypothesis of economic rationality.
The interdisciplinary approach is required, as economics, psychology, sociology, anthropology are domains that help in understanding the complex economic behavior and provide the researchers with complete tools for analysis.
