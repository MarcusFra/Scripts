Description: Europolity – Change and Continuity in European Governance is a biannual peer reviewed open access journal published under the aegis of the Department of International Relations and European Integration of the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration, through the Centre of European Studies (CES). Designed in 2007, it was primarily addressed to young researchers, giving them the opportunity to publish academic papers and opinion articles on topics related to European Union study. Nowadays, edited by CES, Europolity is mainly oriented towards multi-disciplinary scholarly work in European Studies, supporting therefore relevant theoretical, methodological and empirical analyses connected to this field and coming from EU Studies or International Relations, but also from International (Political) Economy, Law, Sociological Studies, Cultural Studies, etc. Journal articles and book reviews are therefore dedicated to in-depth innovative investigations of the European polity, politics and policies, stimulating debate and facilitating academic networking of scholars interested in these topics.
