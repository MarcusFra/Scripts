Name: Peterson Institute Press: Policy Analyses in International Economics
Description: Policy Analyses in International Economics series published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The policy analysis format is best used for topics of narrower scope than those addressed in a full-length book. The topic is typically of shorter-term interest, and the analysis may lead to one or more specific, immediate policy recommendations. The audience for the PAs may be broad, including policymakers at all levels as well as academic specialists. PAs should therefore not be overly technical; technical background materials (e.g., descriptions of econometric models) can be placed in an appendix.
