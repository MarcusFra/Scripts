Description: We are pleased to provide an electronic database (wp.comunite.it) to disseminate works-in-progress reflecting the broad range of research activities of our department members. Our working paper series is devoted to multi-disciplinary topics of humanities, science and social science and is directed towards an audience that includes practitioners, policymakers, scholars, and students. The series aspires to contribute to the body of substantive and methodological knowledge concerning the aforementioned issues. Since much of the research is ongoing, the authors welcome comments from readers; we thus welcome feedback from readers and encourage them to convey comments and criticisms directly to the authors.
