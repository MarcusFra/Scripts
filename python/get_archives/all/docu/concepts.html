<h1>Access to Scientific Literature
on the WWW: the RePEc concept</h1>
<h2><a href="http://openlib.org/home/krichel/">Thomas Krichel</a></h2>
<h2>1998-12-14</h2>

<h2>1: The purpose of RePEc</h2>
<p>RePEc stands for "Research Papers in Economics".  
The word RePEc has three different meanings
<ol>
<li > It is a collection of web or ftp 
archives that provide structured data (something 
like author: Karl Marx \\ Title: Das Kapital) about electronic and 
printed documents in
economics. Each archive is contained in a subdirectory on
the web or ftp server. 
Some archives also make the full text of the papers
available. Others contain URLs for the papers from another
site. Others have no option to downloads papers. The collection of
the data on these archives 
make up the first aspect of RePEc.  
<li > It is a group of people that provide these
servers. This is a mixed group comprising academics, departmental
computing support staff, librarians and other volunteers. By working
in a coordinated way we can achieve a level of service that could
not be reached by each of us working individually. 
<li > The last  
aspect of RePEc is its r&ocirc;le as naming authority. Essentially this
means that each server, each series and each paper is identified by a
unique handle. Each handle starts with the keyword RePEc.
</ol>
The aim of RePEc is to construct a database about all aspects of
research in economics.  The RePEc aims to describe and identify paper,
(working papers and journal articles), collections of papers
(i.e. journals and working paper series), persons who act as authors
of papers and editors of collection, and institutions (which are
collections of persons just like the journals are collections of
articles). By identifying each element, we can update the data
easily. An example: <pre>
Template-Type: ReDIF-Paper 1.0 
Author-Name: Thomas Krichel 
Author-Handle: RePEc:per:05-06-1965:thomas_krichel 
...
Handle: RePEc:sur:surrec:9801
</pre>
 is part of a description of a paper authored by Thomas Krichel.
Somewhere else in the dataset, we find
<pre>
Template-Type: ReDIF-Person 1.0
Name: Thomas Krichel
Email: T.Krichel@surrey.ac.uk
Homepage: http://openlib.org/home/krichel
Handle: RePEc:per:05-06-1965:thomas_krichel
</pre>

This means that when the author Krichel moves from one place to
another, all we need to update is his email address and his
homepage in the second template, and the information will be 
updated in the description of the all papers that Thomas Krichel
has written. Similarly, the handle tut(RePEc:sur:surrec:9801) 
will be a unique identifier for this particular paper. A wide
deployment of this identifier will mean that automated citation
analysis will become possible. Of course these particular 
features are not yet fully developed, but I hope that the
example will give you an idea what RePEc wants to archive.
Basically what we are aiming for is a relational database
system for economics research information. This relational
structure will be one distinctive advantage of RePEc over
existing systems like the  ISI Citation Index and EconLIT. 
The other advantage is that it is freely available to 
anyone in the world who is interested in Economics and 
has internet access.
<p>Skeptics have suggested that such a system will ever emerge. It should
however be noted that the majority of people that push RePEc forward
are young(ish). We know that we have a long way to go, but we also
know where we are going and we know that we have the time to move on.
Up until now we have found working on RePEc an enjoyable and worthwhile
experience.

<h2>2: A look at an archive</h2>
<p>RePEc is founded on two sets of guidelines. "ReDIF" is a template
metadata format. It describes templates for "Paper", "Article",
"Series", "Archive" etc. The Guildford protocol is a convention on how
to store the template files on a publicly accessible computer system
using either ftp or http. The idea is that the data is not maintained
by a single site, but by a number of archives all working
independently.  Let us show an example. The <a href="http;//www.nber.org">National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER)</a> provides a RePEc
archive at <a href="http://nberws.nber.org/RePEc/nbr">http://nberws.nber.org/RePEc/nbr</a>. 
tut(RePEc:nbr) is the handle of the
NBER archive. In the archive, they provide information about the NBER
working papers, handle tut(RePEc:nbr:nberwo) at
<a href="http://nberws.nber.org/RePEc/nbr/nberwo">http://nberws.nber.org/RePEc/nbr/nberwo</a>.  
This directory contains plain
ASCII files, that contain data that
describe research documents. For example there is a template
<pre>
Template-Type: ReDIF-Paper 1.0 
Title: Costs of Equity Capital and Model Mispricing 
Classification-JEL: G12; G31 
Author-Name: Lubos Pastor 
Number: 6490 
Creation-Date: 1998-04 
File-URL: http://www.nber.org/papers/w6490.pdf 
File-Format: application/pdf
File-Restriction: Access to the full text is restricted. Look up http://www.nber.
 org/wwpfaq.html for details, or write to feenberg@nber.org. If you have no access
 to the full text you will be shown an abstract page instead. Anyone browsing the 
 NBER working paper database from a site with a TLD in a non-OECD, non-OPEC
 country will be offered full text downloads for any paper for which the full text
 is available  online, but only if their DNS does reverse name lookup.
Handle: RePEc:nbr:nberwo:6490
Price: $5.00 per paper (plus $10.00 postage for orders outside U.S.)
</pre>

This record also contains an abstract that has been suppressed here to 
conserve space. It illustrates that the collection is not necessarily limited
to documents that are free. Since the access arrangements vary, the text
of the restriction is free. If the resource is composed out of
several files, then a construction like <code>File-URL:</code>,
<code>File-Format:</code> and <code>File-Restriction:</code> is used for each file, and
an extra field <code>File-Function:</code> may be added.
<p>The most important feature of the ReDIF data is the handle
structure. In our example, the handle tut(Handle: RePEc:nbr:nberwo:6490)
 contains both information about the archive, the series as well as an
identifier for the paper. This hierarchical structure is evident in
this case.  In other situation that structure may be different. In
fact RePEc is planning to build a handle structure for authors and
institutions. These data could then be kept up to date. For example if
the author moves, her new email address would only need to be changed
at one place.
<p>RePEc does not follow an existing or emerging internet standard. The
advantage is that the RePEc metadata format it very flexible and can
be altered as new needs arise. The metadata is simple enough that
support staff working for departments and research institutions can
create and amend ReDIF records with minimum difficulties. If the
format would be more general it would also make it more difficult to
encode.

<h2>3: Data and services</h2>
<p>The RePEc data sits in archives, but that is not the form the user
would normally access it. The user of the data can address one or more
user services that render the data. There is no official user service
for RePEc, but a variety of user services. They include
<a href="http://ideas.uqam.ca">IDEAS</a> in Canada,
<a href="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/WoPEc.html">WoPEc</a> who operate in the UK,
US and Japan, as well as the Russian
<a href="http://www.ieie.nsc.ru/RuPEc/">RuPEc</a> service.  A <a href="http://dbiref.kub.nl:3307/Alex.cgi?newdbname=repec&action=selectdatabase&language=english">Z39.50
service</a>
is being prepared in the Netherlands.
 There is also a current awareness service called "<a href="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/NEP">NEP: New
Economics Papers</a>".  All these services
use the same data from all archives. Each site that provides services
regularly runs a piece of software that will update their local
holdings of remote archives. The services all run independently but
the providers of RePEc data will enjoy simultaneous exposure in all
the services. This is a significant advantage.
