Description:
The Department of Economics at the University of Zurich is a leading European research center that represents a wide range of research interests in all areas of economics, including econometrics, macroeconomics, microeconomics, and neuroeconomics. The research conducted at the department has an interdisciplinary focus, combining modern economics with elements from history, political science, psychology, biology, and sociology. 
Due to the merger of the Institute for Empirical Research in Economics and the Socioeconomic Institute into the Department of Economics, the two working paper series' of the former institutes have been combined.

Name: IEW - Working Papers
Description: The Institute for Empirical Research in Economics
 is part of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Zürich. 
 The Institute is endowed with six chairs (Microeconomics and Experimental Economics, 
 Economic Policy and Non-Market Economics, Econometrics and Applied Statistics, Financial 
 Economics and Monetary Macroeconomics, Economic History, Macroeconomics,) and has a 
 strong commitment to top research in theoretical and empirical economics. As a part of this 
 commitment the Institute recently started a new working paper series. The first 20 working papers 
 cover already a wide range of topics and some of them deal with long-standing and still unresolved 
 questions in economics. Topics comprise empirical labor economics, empirical and theoretical 
 macroeconomics, economic history and questions at the intersection of economics and psychology. 
 Since we just filled our vacant chair in Financial Economics, there will also be a flow of contributions in 
 this field in the future. Methodologically, the authors apply methods developed by behavioral and 
 experimental economists as well as the standard methods of econometrics, optimization theory and game theory. 
 We hope that the plurality of methods and approaches provides a mix of exciting and important research results 
 that will be appreciated by the scientific community and the larger public.
