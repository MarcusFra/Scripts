Romanian Economic Research”, Study notebook no.9/1999, with the title “The consumer – manufacturing enterprise partnership”, the opportunity of optimizing the correlation: promoting the consumer (in the context of the reform of national trade, including developing logistic distribution structures adapted to local needs) – preserving competitive markets (in the context of the globalization of economy) was pointed out, as in the following year other conclusions were brought forward, in works such as, for example, « Marketing. Evolutions, experiences, conceptual developments», Expert Publishing House, 2000; as C.R.D.’s status clearly points out the importance of seeking to promote sustainable development, in 2000, CRD organized, together with the “International Foundation Health – Environment – Sustainable development ” and in partnership with “ION RATIU” Romanian Parliamentarians Club , the Symposium ”The Economy of Ideas and Sustainable development”, first reported by the “Tribuna Economica” Journal, no. 18/3 May 2000 - the discussions that took place at the Parliament House, on the occasion of the works of the Symposium on May 16, 2000, were based on the study  “Sustainable development : principles and action”, Beniamin Cotigaru, Theodor Purcarea, coordinators, Millenium Publishing House, May 2000, interdisciplinary research representing a turning point in developing a national strategy for sustainable development; it was also discussed, in the context, the opportunity to exploit the model of Product Development Research/CDP in meeting sustainable development, CDP representing product trajectory as a specific methodological instrument; starting with 2000, C.R.D. emphasized the impressive European solution to the first key stage of category management (deciding upon the definitions of categories and measurement criteria), as well as the importance of the existence of a complete dynamic picture of the integrated supply chain management of all producers and distributors in a country; C.R.D. analyzed and debated, since its formation, the framework which generated the export of the best managerial practices in the field, including the effects of involving certain global dominators in the food distribution in Romania (otherwise, for example, representatives of Carrefour, Metro and Cora accepted CRD’s invitation, participating on March 13, 2001, at the Parliament Palace, at the International Symposium « The distribution of fresh products », a real professional turning point, with corresponding effectsl the symposium appeared as a turning moment and later, in the weekly “European Business” Journal, no.21/ 3-9 November 2004, which pointed out, in the context, the outline of the ECR Romania Association’ structuring); on the occasion of the Jubilee Session with the topic „ Engineers’ managerial training. Traditions and perspectives”, held at Politehnica University in Bucharest, 9.06.2001, C.R.D. made its views known regarding knowledge imperatives at the level of the relation engineer – manager;  C.R.D. actions were enrolled in a common endeavor for the normalization of the competitive environment, to prevent inefficiency and to increase the overall level of performance, for partnerships and loyal competition in the distribution process, to increase welfare by offering the possibility of options - it is worth remembering, in this context, the aspects mentioned in the 1997 Report (p. 561), 1998 Report (pp. 66-67), 1999 Report (p. 53) and 2001 Report( p. 64 ), of the Competition Council, concerning the collaboration with the Romanian Distribution Committee; in 2004 C.R.D. signaled, for example, a series of priorities within the approach of the distribution –related issues: why, how, when and at what price will the identification via radio frequency be imposed, in the context of the significant advantages that it will bring especially at the level of supply chain management (SCM); contribution of a uniform standard, bar code and electronic message to the optimization of logistic performances; the way in which it can optimize the compatibility between logistics constraints and the quality imperatives of service and products offered; the three pillars of packaging: product, logistics, the environment; legal quality and practical priority issues, during the elaboration of a global strategy for transport, handling and warehousing; productivity improvement and reduction of costs in the partnership producer – distributor – logistics provider; new geomarketing applications and so on; C.R.D. sent another essential message in what concerns promoting the partnership in spreading knowledge (“Clear trends in managing information in Romanian enterprises. The evolution, strategies and magazines of the future”) on the occasion of the Symposium QBIT – IBM – Geac with the topic “Informatics solutions compatible with European audit, a necessary step in the view of receiving the status of functional market economy” and whose works were carried out at Crowne Plaza Bucharest, 27.05.2004; in 1996 C.R.D. organized the first National ECR Symposium, in partnership with Valahia University in Targoviste, and in 1999,on the occasion of the third National ECR Symposium organized by C.R.D. a Point of view was elaborated (“Modern distribution and information technology as a strategic resource”) and sent to the Parliament, the Government and the academic environment, also taken into consideration by the media. This happened in the context in which in the previous period of time, in the world, working groups were constituted for the development of a global standard in the distribution field, the executive management being ensured by the representatives of the ECR and VICS leadership (“Voluntary Industry Commerce Standards”), as well as of some prestigious transnational distributors and producers; in 2006, the Romanian Distribution Committee, in collaboration with Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies and UGIR 1903 organized the Symposium (launching a partnership project) with the topic “Institutional-spiritual reconstruction of enterprises, requirement for sustainable development in the knowledge society”, a nationwide premiere; also, the volume that contains this project, which appeared in April 2006 at ASE Publishing House and in which, at page 488, reference is made to „RESPAD Trophy” offered by CRD, among other things emphasizing the correlation between real success and the vision of the training team; in „Additional information regarding the event”, distributed on the occasion of the works of the symposium, the hope was expressed as to what concerns the significance „of a new partnership of public-private interests post-accession in the European Union where the education and research, employers and administration, business governance will find solutions concerning common problems of our lives regarding enterprises competitiveness, pollution of the environment and poverty, the control of risks that the evolution in the new complexity of the world of uncertainties generates…”; it is relevant to remember that the many televised debates, starting with March 2008, on the topic of the so-called „war of supermarkets”, would have been much more grounded if it had been taken into account that anyone could have read in electronic format just a year before in „Competition’s Review”, March 2007 (File. Distribution market), the article “The fastest impact of Romania joining the European Union. The reality and the particularity of distribution” (Theodor Purcarea, pp. pag. 38-43); on April 9, 2009, as a result of the partnership , under the patronage of the Academy of Medical Sciences and Bucharest City Hall, between the University of Medicine and Pharmacy “Carol Davila” – Bucharest, Romanian Distribution Committee and A.I.D.A. Brussels, the Conference SANABUNA 2009 was held at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy “Carol Davila” , which approached the imperative of reflection and responsible action on the issue “Health, Nutrition, and Wellbeing”, seeking to identify that new necessary direction of attitudes that would allow the establishment of a partnership between the public and the private sector meant to offer proper solutions for influencing the change in behavior in order to improve the economic – social health and responsibility (the event’s interdisciplinary character allowed covering certain new aspects, starting from the harmonization of the preoccupations related to building a truly better life, in the context of the pressure of the awareness concerning the connections between health, food and the different aspects of businesses and the imperative of identifying the right answers in the confrontation with the welfare reform, reconfiguring consistent ways with fundamental values, education being in the center of the adaptation, and solidarity could not be neglected.); in May 2009 C.R.D. suggested organizing a series of debates aiming at the reconciliation of the market with the public policy aspirations; followed by the First International Congress ,,Health-Nutrition-Wellbeing” took place at Aro Palace Hotel, Brasov, 15-17 October, 2011 (http://www.crd-aida.ro/activitiespartnership/sanabuna-2011/ ), and the Second International Congress “Health, Nutrition, Fitness and Wellbeing for Central & Southeast Europe”, SANABUNA 2012 (http://www.sanabuna.ro/the-second-international-congress-health-nutrition-fitness-and-wellbeing-for-central-southeast-europe-sanabuna-2012-took-place-on-the-19th-21st-october-at-the-art-museum/).
