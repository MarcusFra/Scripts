Description: The PDGA and the Harvard Initiative for Global Health invites members of the public health community to submit working papers reflecting their research. The purpose of our Working Paper Series is to share research prior to journal publication and stimulate debate and critical comments. Working papers also give an opportunity to authors to publish longer and more detailed material than can appear in a journal.
