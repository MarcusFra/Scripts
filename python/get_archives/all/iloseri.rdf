Name:Global Employment Trends Reports
Description: With a view to developing information and analysis that is essential for promoting
 full, decent and productive work for all, including women and young people, the Global Employment
 Trends series review global and regional economic and labour market developments based on the
 most recently available data. The reports build on the Key Indicators of the Labour Market
 (KILM), and include a consistent set of tables with regional and global estimates of labour
 market indicators as generated from the Estimates and projections of labour market indicators.
 Each issue of Global Employment Trends also contains a short term labour market outlook based
 on projections or scenarios, focusing on unemployment, vulnerable employment and working poverty.
 The reports have been published on a yearly basis since 2003, with special editions to analyze
 labour market trends for segments of the population such as youth (2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010)
 and women (2004, 2007, 2008 and 2009), or for certain regions. The January 2009 issue focused
 on the labour market impact of the global economic crisis. An update of the crisis impact was
 issued in May 2009. The gender impact of the crisis was the main subject of the Global Employment
 Trends for Women in March 2009.
 A word of caution: Each GET, its data and analysis, is the result of a new run of the
 Global Employment Trends Model, which uses as input the latest available labour market information
 from the ILO and other sources to generate the world and regional aggregates. This means each
 new report is based on the best available estimates at that point in time and that the time series
 of world and regional aggregates from one report to the next are not comparable. The most recent
 GET should always be taken as the most up-to-date source of world and regional estimates of labour
 market information.

Name:Studies on Growth with Equity
Description: The Research Department launched in 2010 the Studies on Growth with Equity research series. 
 These studies with a country and thematic focus show how labour market and social policies can contribute
 to a more stable and equitable growth pattern and improved labour market and social outcomes. In particular, 
 in order to contribute to the debate regarding what works in terms of policies, the Studies on Growth with 
 Equity series assesses the policy options and conditions required to improve employment and social outcomes 
 on the base of a job-friendly strategy and defines a role for the ILO in facilitating a shift to job-friendly
 policies.
