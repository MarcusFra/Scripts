Description: The explicit aim of the Far East Journal of Marketing and Management is the dissemination of insightful and original marketing and management knowledge. We welcome novel and ground-breaking contributions from a wide range of research traditions within the broad domain of Management and marketing, particularly encouraging innovative ideas in conceptual developments and research methodologies. The Far East Journal of Marketing and Management are not preferentially disposed towards either empirical work or pure theory, nor towards one particular method or approach. Although the Far East Journal of Marketing and Management will retain a national and international brand identity, we actively encourage global contributions, from scholars across the broad domain of marketing. The Far East Journal of Marketing and Management are receptive to controversial topics, and new, as well as developments that challenge existing theories and paradigms.
