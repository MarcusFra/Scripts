Description: The purpose of the FIW Working Paper series is to circulate the results of ongoing research in international economics within the Austrian research community and thus to encourage discussion and stimulate critical comments within the field as well as to enhance networking and potential cooperation among researchers. Submitted paper should be confined to topics within the field of international economics (JEL-codes F and also O) and employ scientific methods in the analysis and / or be of relevance to economic policy questions. Empirical, theoretical as well as policy-oriented contributions are welcome. Submitted papers are subject to a screening process to ensure that they fall into the above specified topic as well as to ensure the general quality of the paper. However, there is no proper refereeing process in view of the intention of the series to stimulate discussion among the research community and to allow for suggestions for revision before submission to a scientific journal.
