Description: The focus for the volumes is laboratory experimental economics, but authors of theoretical, empirical, or field economic research are welcome to submit work if it would be of interest to the broader experimental economics community. It is a goal of Research in Experimental Economics to be complementary with, and not in competition with, traditional journals as outlets for experimental work. Research in Experimental Economics has the freedom to consider papers that may not be appropriate for traditional journals for a variety of reasons. Some examples of these strengths include: theme volumes, replication studies, research which requires longer manuscripts for presentation of data or analysis, and papers on methodological topics.
