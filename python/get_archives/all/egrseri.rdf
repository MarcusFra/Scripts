Name: European Journal of Government and Economics
Description: The European Journal of Government and Economics (Online ISSN 2254-7088) is an international academic journal for peer reviewed research on all aspects of government and economics. EJGE is particularly interested in current issues regarding the interrelationship between the fields of government and economics, from the influence of government on the economy (economic policy) to economic explanations of government (public choice). It is also particularly interested in questions directly or indirectly related to Europe. Contributions will be valued by the substantial relavance of their research questions as well as their originality. The latter may consist in the development of new models to explain existing data, the aplication of existing models to new data sets, or (ideally) a combination of both.
